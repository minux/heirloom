.SH NAME
sh, jsh \- the standard command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsh\fR [\fB\-acefhiknprstuvx\fR] [\fIarg\fR] ...
.br
\fBjsh\fR [\fB\-acefhiknprstuvx\fR] [\fIarg\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sh
is a command programming language
that executes commands read from a terminal
or a file.
See the
.I invocation
section
for the meaning of arguments to the shell.
.SS Commands
A
.I simple-command
is a sequence of non blank
.I words
separated by blanks (a blank is a
.B tab
or a
.BR space ).
The first word specifies the name of the command to
be executed.
Except as specified below
the remaining words are passed as arguments
to the invoked command.
The command name is passed as argument 0
(see
.IR exec (2)).
The
.I value
of a simple-command is its exit status
if it terminates normally or 200+\fIstatus\fP if
it terminates abnormally (see
.IR signal (2)
for a list of
status values).
.PP
A
.I pipeline
is a sequence of one or more
.I commands
separated by
.B \(or.
The standard output of each command but the last
is connected by a
.IR pipe (2)
to the standard input of the next command.
Each command is run as a separate process;
the shell waits for the last command to terminate.
The
.I value
of a pipeline
is the exit status of its last command.
.PP
A
.I list
is a sequence of one or more
.I pipelines
separated by
.BR ; ,
.BR & ,
.B &&
or
.B \(or\|\(or
and optionally terminated by
.B ;
or
.BR & .
.B ;
and
.B &
have equal precedence
which is lower than that of
.B &&
and
.BR \(or\|\(or ,
.B &&
and
.B \(or\|\(or
also have equal precedence.
A semicolon causes sequential execution; an ampersand causes
the preceding
.I pipeline
to be executed without waiting for it to finish.
The symbol
.B &&
.RB ( \(or\|\(or )
causes the
.I list
following to be executed only if the preceding
.I pipeline
returns a zero (non zero) value.
Newlines may appear in a
.I list,
instead of semicolons,
to delimit commands.
.PP
A
.B #
at the beginning of a word
starts a comment and
causes the rest of the line to be ignored.
.PP
A
.I command
is either a simple-command
or one of the following.
The value returned by a command is that of the
last simple-command executed in the command.
.TP
\fBfor \fIname\fR [\fBin \fIword\fR ...] \fBdo \fIlist \fBdone\fR
Each time a
.B for
command is executed
.I name
is set to the next word in the
.B for
word list
If
.BI in \ word
\&...
is omitted then
.B
in "$@"
is assumed.
Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.
.TP
\fBcase \fIword \fBin\fR [\fIpattern \fR[\fB\(or \fIpattern \fR] ... \fB) \fIlist \fB;;\fR] ... \fBesac\fR
A
.B case
command executes the
.I list
associated with the first
pattern that matches
.I word.
The form of the patterns is
the same as that used for
file name generation.
.TP
\fBif \fIlist \fBthen \fIlist\fR [\fBelif \fIlist \fBthen \fIlist\fR] ... [\fBelse \fIlist\fR] \fBfi\fR
The
.I list
following
.B if
is executed and if it returns zero the
.I list
following
.B then
is executed.
Otherwise, the
.I list
following
.B elif
is executed and if its value is zero
the
.I list
following
.B then
is executed.
Failing that the
.B else
.I list
is executed.
.TP
\fBwhile \fIlist\fR [\fBdo \fIlist\fR] \fBdone\fR
A
.B while
command repeatedly executes the
.B while
.I list
and if its value is zero executes the
.B do
.I list;
otherwise the loop terminates.
The value returned by a
.B while
command is that
of the last executed command in the
.B do
.I list.
.B until
may be used in place of
.B while
to negate
the loop termination test.
.TP
.BI ( " list " )
Execute
.I list
in a subshell.
.TP
.BI { " list" "; }"
.I list
is simply executed.
.TP
\fIname\fB() { \fIlist\fB; }\fR
Defines the shell function
.IR name.
Each time when
.I name
is recognized as a command,
.I list
is executed,
with the positional parameters
.IR $1 ", " $2 ...
set to the arguments of the command.
After the function returns,
the previous positional parameters are restored.
.PP
The following words
are only recognized as the first word of a command
and when not quoted.
.IP
.B
if then else elif fi case in esac for while until do done { }
.SS "Command substitution"
The standard output from a command enclosed in
a pair of grave accents
.RB ( \`\|\` )
may be used as part or all
of a word;
trailing newlines are removed.
.SS "Parameter substitution"
The character
.B $
is used to introduce substitutable
parameters.
Positional parameters may be assigned values by
.BR set .
Variables may be set by writing
.IP
.IB name = value
[
.IB name = value
] ...
.TP
$\fB\|{\fIparameter\fB\|}\fR
A
.I parameter
is a sequence of letters, digits or underscores (a
.IR name ),
a digit,
or any of the characters
.B
* @ # ? \- $ !\|.
The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted.
The braces are required only when
.I parameter
is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore
that is not to be interpreted as part of its name.
If
.I parameter
is a digit then it is a positional parameter.
If
.I parameter
is
.BR * " or" " @"
then all the positional
parameters, starting with
.SM
.BR $1 ,
are substituted
separated by spaces.
.SM
.B $0
is set from argument zero when the shell
is invoked.
.TP
$\fB\|{\fIparameter:\-word\|\fB}\fR
If
.I parameter
is set and not empty then substitute its value;
otherwise substitute
.I word.
.TP
$\fB\|{\fIparameter:=word\|\fB}\fR
If
.I parameter
is not set and not empty then set it to
.I word;
the value of the parameter is then substituted.
Positional parameters may not be assigned to
in this way.
.TP
$\fB\|{\fIparameter:?word\|\fB}\fR
If
.I parameter
is set and not empty then substitute its value;
otherwise, print
.I word
and exit from the shell.
If
.I word
is omitted then a standard message is printed.
.TP
$\fB\|{\fIparameter:+word\|\fB}\fR
If
.I parameter
is set and not empty then substitute
.I word;
otherwise substitute nothing.
.PP
If the
.B :
is omitted,
the substitutions are only executed
if the
.I parameter
is set, even if it is empty.
.PP
In the above
.I word
is not evaluated unless it is
to be used as the substituted string.
(So that, for example,
echo ${d\-\`pwd\`}
will only execute
.I pwd
if
.I d
is unset.)
.PP
The following
.I parameters
are automatically set by the shell.
.RS
.TP
.B #
The number of positional parameters in decimal.
.PD 0
.TP
.B \-
Options supplied to the shell on invocation or by
.BR set .
.TP
.B ?
The value returned by the last executed command
in decimal.
.TP
.B $
The process number of this shell.
.TP
.B !
The process number of the last background command invoked.
.PD
.RE
.PP
The following
.I parameters
are used by the shell:
.RS
.TP
.PD 0
.SM
.B CDPATH
The search path for the
.I cd
command (see above).
.TP
.SM
.B HOME
The default argument (home directory) for the
.B cd
command.
.TP
.SM
.B OPTARG
The value of the last option argument processed by the
.I getopts
special command.
.TP
.SM
.B OPTIND
The index of the last option processed by the
.I getopts
special command.
.TP
.SM
.B PATH
The search path for commands (see
.BR execution ).
.TP
.SM
.B MAIL
If this variable is set to the name of
a mail file then the shell informs the user of
the arrival of mail in the specified file.
.TP
.SM
.B MAILCHECK
If this variable is set,
it is interpreted as a value in seconds
to wait between checks for new mail.
The default is 600 (10 minutes).
If the value is zero,
mail is checked before each prompt.
.TP
.SM
.B MAILPATH
A colon-separated list of files
that are checked for new mail.
.SM MAIL
is ignored if this variable is set.
.SM
.TP
.SM
.B PS1
Primary prompt string, by default `$ '.
.TP
.SM
.B PS2
Secondary prompt string, by default `> '.
.TP
.SM
.B IFS
Internal field separators,
normally
.BR space ,
.BR tab ,
and
.BR newline .
.TP
.SM
.B SHACCT
If this variable is set in the initial environment passed to the shell
and points to a file writable by the user,
accounting statistics are written to it.
.TP
.SM
.B TIMEOUT
The shell exists when prompting for input
if no command is entered
for more than the given value in seconds.
A value of zero means no timeout
and is the default.
.PD
.RE
.SS "Blank interpretation"
After parameter and command substitution,
any results of substitution are scanned for internal field separator
characters (those found in
.SM
.BR $IFS \*S)
and split into distinct arguments where such characters are found.
Explicit null arguments ("" or \'\') are retained.
Implicit null arguments
(those resulting from
.I parameters
that have no values) are removed.
.SS "File name generation"
Following substitution, each command word is scanned for
the characters
.BR * ,
.B ?
and
.B [.
If one of these characters appears
then the word is regarded as a pattern.
The word is replaced with alphabetically sorted file names that match the pattern.
If no file name is found that matches the pattern then
the word is left unchanged.
The character
.B .
at the start of a file name
or immediately following a
.BR / ,
and the character
.BR / ,
must be matched explicitly.
.TP 
.B *
Matches any string, including the null string.
.PD 0
.TP 
.B ?
Matches any single character.
.TP 
.B [...]
Matches any one of the characters
enclosed.
A pair of characters separated by
.B \-
matches any
character lexically between the pair.
.TP
.B [!...]
Matches any character except the enclosed ones.
.PD
.SS "Quoting"
The following characters have a special meaning to the shell
and cause termination of a word unless quoted.
.PP
	\fB;   &   (   )   \(or   <   >   newline   space   tab\fP
.PP
A character may be
.I quoted
by preceding
it with a
.B
\\\|.
.B \\\\newline
is ignored.
All characters enclosed between a pair of quote marks (\fB\'\|\'\fP),
except a single quote,
are quoted.
Inside double quotes
(\fB"\|"\fP)
parameter and command substitution occurs and
.B
\\
quotes the characters
.B
\\ \` "
and
.BR $ \|.
.PP
.B
"$*"
is equivalent to
.SM
.B
"$1 $2 ..."
whereas
.br
.B
"$@"
is equivalent to
.SM
.B
"$1" "$2" ... .
.SS "Prompting"
When used interactively,
the shell prompts with the value of
.SM $PS1
before reading a command.
If at any time a newline is typed and further input is needed
to complete a command then the secondary prompt
(\s-1$PS2\s0)
is issued.
.SS "Input and output"
Before a command is executed its input and output
may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell.
The following may appear anywhere in a simple-command
or may precede or follow a
.I command
and are not passed on to the invoked command.
Substitution occurs before
.I word
or
.I digit
is used.
.TP
\fB<\fI\|word\fP
Use file
.I word
as standard input (file descriptor 0).
.PD
.TP
\fB>\fI\|word\fP
Use file
.I word
as standard output (file descriptor 1).
If the file does not exist then it is created;
otherwise it is truncated to zero length.
.TP
\fB>>\fI\|word\fP
Use file
.I word
as standard output.
If the file exists then output is appended (by seeking to the end);
otherwise the file is created.
.TP
\fB<<\fR[\fB\-\fR]\fI\|word\fP
The shell input is read up to a line the same as
.IR word ,
or end of file.
The resulting document becomes
the standard input.
If any character of
.I word
is quoted then no interpretation
is placed upon the characters of the document;
otherwise, parameter and command substitution occurs,
.B
\\newline
is ignored,
and
.B
\\
is used to quote the characters
.B
\\ $ \`
and the first character of
.I word.
The optional
.B \-
causes leading tabulator character to be stripped
from the resulting document;
.I word
may then also be prefixed by a tabulator.
.TP
\fB<\|&\|\fIdigit\fP
The standard input is duplicated from file descriptor
.I digit;
see
.IR dup (2).
Similarly for the standard output using >\|.
.TP
\fB<\|&\|\-
The standard input is closed.
Similarly for the standard output using >\|.
.PD
.PP
If one of the above is preceded by a digit
then the
file descriptor created is that specified
by the digit
(instead of the default 0 or 1).
For example,
.PP
	\&... 2>&1
.PP
creates file descriptor 2 to be a duplicate
of file descriptor 1.
.PP
If a command is followed by
.B &
then the default standard input
for the command
is the empty file
(/dev/null).
Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the
file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by input
output specifications.
.SS "Environment"
The environment
is a list of name-value pairs that is passed to
an executed program in the same way as a normal argument list;
see
.IR exec (2)
and
.IR environ (5).
The shell interacts with the environment in several ways.
On invocation, the shell scans the environment
and creates a
.I parameter
for each name found,
giving it the corresponding value.
Executed commands inherit the same environment.
If the user modifies the values of these
.I parameters
or creates new ones,
none of these affects the environment
unless the
.I export
command is used to bind the shell's
.I parameter
to the environment.
The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed
of any unmodified name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell,
plus any modifications or additions,
all of which must be noted in
.I export
commands.
.PP
The environment for any
.I simple-command
may be augmented by prefixing it with one or more assignments to
.I parameters.
Thus these two lines are equivalent
.IP
TERM=450 cmd args
.br
(export TERM; TERM=450; cmd args)
.PP
If the
.I \-k
flag is set,
.I all
keyword arguments are placed in the environment,
even if the occur after the command name.
The following prints `a=b c' and `c':
.nf
echo a=b c
set \-k
echo a=b c
.fi
.SS "Signals"
The INTERRUPT and QUIT signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
.BR & ;
otherwise signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent.
(But see also
.IR trap. )
.SS "Execution"
Each time a command is executed the above substitutions
are carried out.
The shell then first looks if a function with the command name was defined;
if so, it is chosen for execution.
Otherwise, except for the `special commands' listed below a new
process is created and
an attempt is made to execute the command via an
.IR exec (2).
.PP
The shell parameter
.SM $PATH
defines the search path for
the directory containing the command.
Each alternative directory name is separated by
a colon
.RB ( : ).
The default path is
`/usr/5bin:/bin:/usr/bin:'.
If the command name contains a / then the search path
is not used.
Otherwise, each directory in the path is
searched for an executable file.
If the file has execute permission but is not an
.I a.out
file,
it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands.
A subshell (i.e., a separate process) is spawned to read it.
A parenthesized command is also executed in
a subshell.
.SS "Special commands"
The following commands are executed in the shell process itself:
.TP
.B :
No effect; the command does nothing.
.PD 0
.TP
.BI . \ file
Read and execute commands from
.I file
and return.
The search path
.SM $PATH
is used to find the directory containing
.IR file .
.TP
\fBbreak\fR [\fIn\fR]
Exit from the enclosing
.I for
or
.I while
loop, if any.
If
.I n
is specified then break
.I n
levels.
.TP
\fBcontinue\fR [\fIn\fR]
Resume the next iteration of the enclosing
.I for
or
.I while
loop.
If
.I n
is specified then resume at the
.IR n -th
enclosing loop.
.TP
\fBcd\fR [\fIarg\fR]
Change the current directory to
.I arg.
The shell
parameter
.SM $HOME
is the default
.IR arg .
If no directory
.I arg
is found and the
.SM $CDPATH
parameter contains a list of directories separated by colons,
each of these directories is used as a prefix to
.I arg
in the given order,
and the current directory is set to the first one that is found.
.TP
\fBecho\fR [\fIarg \fR...]
Each
.I arg
is printed to standard output;
afterwards, a newline is printed.
The following escapes sequences are recognized in
.IR arg :
.PD 0
.RS
.TP 7n
.B \eb
Prints a backspace character.
.TP
.B \ec
Causes the command to return immediately.
Any following characters are ignored,
and the terminating newline is not printed.
.TP
.B \ef
Prints a formfeed character.
.TP
.B \en
Prints a newline character.
.TP
.B \er
Prints a carriage-return character.
.TP
.B \et
Prints a tabulator character.
.TP
.B \ev
Prints a vertical tabulator character.
.TP
.B \e\e
Prints a backslash character.
.TP
.BI \e0 nnn
Prints the character (byte) with octal value
.IR nnn .
.PD
.PP
If
.I /usr/ucb
precedes
.I /usr/5bin
or
.I /usr/bin
in the current setting of the
.SM $PATH
variable and the first argument is
.BR \-n ,
the terminating newline is not printed,
and no escape sequences are recognized.
If the
.B $SYSV3
variable is set in the initial environment passed to the shell,
the
.I \-n
argument is also interpreted,
but escape sequences are processed as usual.
.RE
.TP
\fBeval\fR [\fIarg \fR...]
The arguments are read as input
to the shell
and the resulting command(s) executed.
.TP
\fBexec\fR [\fIarg \fR...]
The command specified by
the arguments is executed in place of this shell
without creating a new process.
Input output arguments may appear and if no other
arguments are given cause the shell input
output to be modified.
.TP
\fBexit\fR [\fIn\fR]
Causes the shell to exit
with the exit status specified by
.I n.
If
.I n
is omitted then the exit status is that of the last command executed.
(An end of file will also exit from the shell.)
.TP
\fBexport\fR [\fIname\fR ...]
The given names are marked
for automatic export to the
.I environment
of subsequently-executed commands.
If no arguments are given then a list of
exportable names is printed.
.\".TP
.\"\fBlogin\fR [\fIarg\fR ...]
.\"Equivalent to `exec login arg ...'.
.TP
\fBgetopts optstring variable\fR [\fIarg\fR ...]
Retrieves options and option-arguments
from
.I arg
(or the positional parameters)
similar to
.IR getopt (3).
.I optstring
is a list of characters (bytes);
each character represents an option letter.
A character followed by
.B :
indicates that the option has an argument.
Calling
.I getopts
repeatedly causes one option to be retrieved per call.
The index of the current option is stored in the variable
.SM OPTIND;
it is initialized to 1 when the shell starts.
The option-argument, if any, is stored in the
.SM OPTARG
variable.
The option character is stored in the
.I variable
named.
When the end of the options is reached,
.I getopts
returns with a non-zero value.
A missing argument or an illegal option
also causes a non-zero return value,
and an error message is printed to standard error.
.TP
\fBhash\fR [\fIname\fR ...]
The shell maintains a hash table
of the locations of external commands.
If
.I name
arguments are given,
each one is looked up and is inserted into the table if it is found.
Otherwise,
a list of the commands currently in the table is printed.
.TP
\fBnewgrp\fR [\fIarg \fR...]
Equivalent to `exec newgrp arg ...'.
.TP
.B pwd
Prints the name of the current directory.
.TP
\fBread\fR [\fB\-r\fR] \fIname\fR ...
One line is read from the standard input;
successive words of the input are assigned to the
variables
.I name
in order,
with leftover words to the last variable.
The return code is 0 unless the end-of-file is encountered.
Normally, backslashes in the line read escape the following character;
this is inhibited if the
.B \-r
option is given.
.TP
\fBreadonly\fR [\fIname \fR...]
The given names are marked readonly and
the values of the these names may not be changed
by subsequent assignment.
If no arguments are given then a list
of all readonly names is printed.
.TP
\fBreturn\fR [\fIn\fR]
Return from a shell function to the execution level above.
With the argument
.IR n ,
the special variable
.I $?
is set to the given value.
.TP
\fBset\fR [\fB\-\-aefhknptuvx\fR [\fIarg \fR...]]
.RS

.B \-a
Export any variables that are modified or created from now on.
.TP
.B \-e
If non interactive then exit immediately if a command fails.
.TP
.B \-f
File name generation is disabled.
.TP
.B \-h
When a function is defined,
look up all external commands it contains as described for the
.I hash
special command.
Normally, these commands are looked up when they are executed.
.TP
.B \-k
All keyword arguments are placed in the environment for a command,
not just those that precede the command name.
.TP
.B \-n
Read commands but do not execute them.
.TP
.B \-t
Exit after reading and executing one command.
.TP
.B \-u
Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
.TP
.B \-v
Print shell input lines as they are read.
.TP
.B \-x
Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
.TP
.B \-
Turn off the

non zero exit status is returned.
.I test
returns a non zero exit if there are no arguments.

The following primitives are used to construct
.IR expr :
.PD 0
.TP 12n
.BR \-r " file"
true if the file exists and is readable.
.TP
.BR \-w " file"
true if the file exists and is writable.
.TP
.BR \-f " file"
true if the file exists and is not a directory.
.TP
.BR \-d " file"
true if the file exists and is a directory.
.TP
.BR \-h " file"
true if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
.TP
.BR \-L " file"
true if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
.TP
.BR \-p " file"
true if the file exists and is a named pipe.
.TP
.BR \-s " file"
true if the file exists and has a size greater than zero.
.TP
.BR \-t " [fildes]"
true if the open file whose file descriptor number is
.I fildes
(1 by default)
is associated with a terminal device.
.TP
.BR \-z " s1"
true if the length of string
.I s1
is zero.
.TP
.BR \-n " s1"
true if the length of the string
.I s1
is nonzero.
.TP
.RB s1 " = " s2
true
if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are equal.
.TP
.RB s1 " != " s2
true
if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are not equal.
.TP
s1
true if 
.I s1
is not the null string.
.TP
.RB n1 " \-eq " n2
true if the integers
.I n1
and
.I n2
are algebraically equal.
Any of the comparisons
.BR \-ne ,
.BR \-gt ,
.BR \-ge ,
.BR \-lt ,
or
.BR \-le
may be used in place of
.BR \-eq .
.PD
.PP
These primaries may be combined with the
following operators:
.PD 0
.TP 12n
.B  !
unary negation operator
.TP
.B  \-a
binary
.I and
operator
.TP
.B  \-o
binary
.I or

.TP
.TP 
.BR "( " "expr" " )"
parentheses for grouping.
.PD
.PP 
.B \-a
has higher precedence than
.B \-o.
Notice that all the operators and flags are separate
arguments to
.IR test .
Notice also that parentheses are meaningful
as command separators and must be escaped.

.TP
\fBtrap\fR [\fIarg\fR] [\fIn\fR|\fIname\fR] ...
.I Arg
is a command to be read and executed when the shell
receives signal(s)
.I n.
(Note that
.I arg
is scanned once when
the trap is set and once when the trap
is taken.)
Trap commands are executed in order of signal number.
If
.I arg
is absent then all trap(s)
.I n
are reset
to their original values.
If
.I arg
is the null
string then this signal is ignored by the shell and by invoked commands.
If
.I n
is 0 then the command
.I arg
is executed
on exit from the shell,
otherwise upon receipt of signal
.I n
as numbered in
.IR signal (2).
.I Trap
with no arguments prints a list
of commands associated with each signal number.
A symbolic
.I name
can be used instead of the
.I n
argument;
it is formed by the signal name in the `C' language
minus the
.SM SIG
prefix,
e.\|g.
.SM TERM
for
.SM SIGTERM.
.SM EXIT
is the same as a `0' argument.
.TP
\fBtype\fI name\fR [...]
For each
.IR name ,
prints if it would be executed as a shell function,
as a special command,
or as an external command.
In the last case, the full path name to the command is also printed.
.TP
\fBulimit\fP [\fB\-\fP[\fBHS\fP][\fBa\fP|\fBcdfmnstuv\fP]]

.TP
\fBulimit\fP [\fB\-\fP[\fBHS\fP][\fBc\fP|\fBd\fP|\fBf\fP|\fBm\fP|\fBn\fP|\fBs\fP|\fBt\fP|\fBu\fP|\fBv\fP]] [\fIlimit\fP]
prints or sets hard or soft limits,
as described in
.IR getrlimit (2).
If a
.I limit
argument is present,
the limit setting is changed;
otherwise,
.I ulimit
prints the current setting.
The
.B \-H
option specifies a hard limit that may be raised by the super-user only.
The
.B \-S
option specifies a soft limit that may be raised by the user as long as it
does not exceed the hard limit.
If neither option is specified,
.I ulimit
will set both limits, or print the soft limit, respectively.
If no limit is specified, \-f is assumed.
Any number of limits may be printed at a time.
The following options are accepted to specify limits:
.RS
.TP
.B \-a
print all limits
.TP
.B \-c
maximum core file size in 512-byte blocks
.TP
.B \-d
maximum data segment in kbytes
.TP
.B \-f
maximum file size in 512-byte blocks
.TP
.B \-l
maximum size of locked memory in kbytes
.TP
.B \-m
maximum resident set size in kbytes
.TP 
.B \-n
maximum file descriptor
.TP
.B \-s
maximum stack segment in kbytes
.TP
.B \-t
maximum CPU time in seconds
.TP
.B \-u
maximum number of processes per user
.TP
.B \-v
maximum virtual size in kbytes.
.RE
.TP
\fBumask \fR[\fB\-S\fR] [\fInnn\fR]
The user file creation mask is set to
the octal value
.I nnn
(see
.IR umask (2)).
Symbolic modes as described in
.IR chmod (1)
are also accepted.
If
.I nnn
is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
With the
.B \-S
option, the current mask is printed as a symbolic string.
.TP
\fBunset\fI variable \fR[...]
Unsets each
.I variable
named.
.TP
\fBwait\fP [\fIn\fP]
Wait for the specified process and
report its termination status.
If
.I n
is not given then all currently active child processes are waited for.
The return code from this command is that of
the process waited for.
.PD
.PP
.SS "Invocation"
If the first character of argument zero is
.BR \- ,
commands are read from
.B /etc/profile
and
.BR \s-1$HOME\s0/.\|profile ,
if the respective file exists.
Commands are then read as described below.
The following flags are interpreted by the shell
when it is invoked.
.PD 0
.TP 11n
.BI \-c \ string
If the
.B \-c
flag is present then
commands are read from
.I string\|.
.TP 11n
.B \-s
If the
.B \-s
flag is present or if no
arguments remain
then commands are read from the standard input.
Shell output is written to
file descriptor 2.
.TP 11n
.B \-i
If the
.B \-i
flag is present or
if the shell input and output are attached to a terminal (as told by
.IR gtty )
then this shell is
.I interactive.
In this case the terminate signal
SIGTERM (see
.IR signal (2))
is ignored (so that `kill 0'
does not kill an interactive shell) and the interrupt signal
SIGINT is caught and ignored
(so that
.B wait
is interruptable).
In all cases SIGQUIT is ignored by the shell.
.PD
.PP
The remaining flags and arguments are described under the
.B set
command.
.SS "Job Control"
When an interactive shell is invoked as
.BR jsh ,
job control is enabled.
Any complete command statement forms a job
that can be stopped, restarted, and terminated.
Stopping is done by pressing the
.SM SUSP
key, typically
.IR ^Z .
Jobs are identified by
.I "jod ids"
of the following form:
.TP
.BR % " or " %% " or " %+
The current job.
.TP
.B %\-
The previous job.
.TP
.BI ? string
The job for which the command line uniquely contains
.IR string .
.TP
.BI % number
The job number.
.TP
.I number
The process group id of an existing job.
.TP
.I string
The job for which the command line is uniquely prefixed by
.IR string .
.PP
The following built-in commands are additionally available
with job control:
.TP
\fBbg\fR [\fIjobid\fP ...]
The specified jobs are resumed in the background.
If no
.I jobid
is given,
the current job is assumed.
.TP 
\fBfg\fR [\fIjobid\fP ...]
The specified jobs are resumed in the foreground.
If no
.I jobid
is given,
the current job is assumed.
.TP
\fBjobs\fR [\fB\-p\fR|\fB\-l\fR] [\fIjobid\fP ...] | [\fB\-x\fI command \fR[\fIarguments\fR ...]] 
Reports all stopped or background jobs,
or those specified by
.IR jobid .
The following options are accepted:
.RS
.TP
.B \-l
Additionally reports the process group
.SM ID
and the initial working directory for each job.
.TP
.B \-p
Restricts the output to the process group
.SM ID
of each job.
.TP
\fB\-x \fIcommand \fR[\fIarguments\fR ...]
Replaces any
.I jobid
in
.I command
or
.I arguments
with the corresponding process group
.SM ID
and executes the result.
.RE
.TP
\fBkill\fR [[\fB\-s\fR \fIsignal\fR | \fB\-\fIsignal\fR] \fIjobid\fR ... | \fB-l \fI[status]\fR
Built-in version of
.IR kill (1)
that accepts
.I jobid
arguments.
.TP
\fBstop \fIjobid\fR ...
Stops the execution of the given jobs.
.TP
.B suspend
Stops the execution of the shell.
.TP
\fBwait \fR[\fIjobid\fR]
The wait builtin additionally accepts
.I jobid
arguments.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors
cause the shell
to return a non zero exit status.
If the shell is being used non interactively
then execution of the shell file is abandoned.
Otherwise, the shell returns the exit status of
the last command executed (see also
.IR exit ).
