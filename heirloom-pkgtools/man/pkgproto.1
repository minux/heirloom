.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkgproto\fR scans the indicated paths and generates
.IR prototype (5)
file entries that may be used as input to the
.IR pkgmk (1)
command.
.PP
If no paths are specified on the command line, standard input is assumed to be a list of paths.
If the pathname listed on the command line is a directory, the contents of the directory is searched.
However, if input is read from \fBstdin\fR, a directory specified as a pathname will not be searched.
.TP 10
.B \-i
Ignores symbolic links and records the paths as \fBftype\fR=\fBf\fR (a
file) versus \fBftype\fR=\fBs\fR (symbolic link).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR\fI class\fR
Maps the class of all paths to \fIclass\fR.
.TP 10
\fB\fIpath1\fR
Pathname where objects are located.
.TP
\fB\fIpath2\fR
Pathname which should be substituted on output for \fIpath1\fR.

.SH NOTES
By default, \fBpkgproto\fR creates symbolic link entries for any symbolic link encountered (\fBftype\fR=\fBs\fR).
When you use the \fB\-i\fR option, \fBpkgproto\fR creates a file entry for symbolic links (\fBftype\fR=\fBf\fR).
The
.IR prototype (5)
file would have to be edited to assign such file types as \fBv\fR (volatile), \fBe\fR (editable), or \fBx\fR (exclusive directory).
\fBpkgproto\fR detects linked files.
If multiple files are linked together, the first path encountered is considered the source of the link.
.PP
By default, \fBpkgproto\fR prints prototype entries on the standard output.
However, the output should be saved in a file (named \fBPrototype\fR or \fBprototype\fR,
for convenience) to be used as input to the
.IR pkgmk (1)
command.
