.SH NAME
mail \- send or receive mail among users
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmail\fR [\fB\-epqr\fR] [\fB\-f\fI\ file\fR]
.br
\fBmail\fR [\fB\-t\fR] \fIperson\fR ...
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I mail
with no argument prints a user's mail, message-by-message,
in last-in, first-out order.
For each message, it reads a line from the standard input
to direct disposition of the message.
.TP
newline
Go on to next message.
.TP
d
Delete message and go on to the next.
.TP
p
Print message again.
.TP
\-
Go back to previous message.
.TP
s [\fIfile\fR] ...
Save the message in the named
.I files
(`mbox' default).
.TP
w [\fIfile\fR] ...
Save the message, without a header, in the named
.I files
(`mbox' default).
.TP
m [\fIperson\fR] ...
Mail the message to the named
.I persons
(yourself is default).
.TP
EOT (control-D)
Put unexamined mail back in the mailbox and stop.
.TP
q
Same as EOT.
.TP
.RI ! command
Escape to the Shell to do
.IR command .
.TP
*
Print a command summary.
.PP
When
.I persons
are named,
.I mail
takes the standard input up to an end-of-file (or a line with just `.')
and adds it to each
.I person's
`mail' file.  The message is preceded by the sender's name and a postmark.
Lines that look like postmarks are prepended with `>'.  A
.I person
is either a user name recognized by
.IR  login (1),
an internet address (see
.IR mailaddr (7),
or a recipient on a UUCP remote system, with the login name prefixed 
by the system name and exclamation mark (see
.IR uucp (1C)).
.PP
The
.B \-e
option checks for the existence of mail only
and causes
.B mail
to exit successfully if mail is present.
.PP
The
.B \-f
option causes the named file, for example, `mbox',
to be printed as if it were the mail file.
.PP
The
.B \-p
option causes all messages to be printed
without prompting for disposition.
.PP
An interrupt normally terminates the 
.I mail
command; the mail file is unchanged.
The
.B \-q
option tells
.I mail
to continue after interrupts.
.PP
The
.B \-r
option displays the mail messages in first-in, first-out order.
.PP
The
.B \-t
option causes a `To:' header field to be created
with the names of all recipients.
.PP
When a user logs in he is informed of the presence of mail.
