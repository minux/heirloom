* Hash table for spelling checker has n bits.
* Each word w is hashed by k different (modular) hash functions, hi.
* The bits hi(w), i=1..k, are set for words in the dictionary.
* Assuming independence, the probability that no word of a d-word
* dictionary sets a particular bit is given by the Poisson formula
* P = exp(-y)*y**0/0!, where y=d*k/n.
* The probability that a random string is recognized as a word is then
* (1-P)**k.  For given n and d this is minimum when y=log(2), P=1/2,
* whence one finds, for example, that a 25000-word dictionary in a
* 400000-bit table works best with k=11.
