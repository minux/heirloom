Notes for the 'oawk' utility
============================

Based on 4.4BSD old awk, the following changes were made:

- Support for LC_CTYPE (especially multibyte characters).
- Support for LC_COLLATE (when comparing string variables).
- Support for LC_TIME (radix character).
- No limit on the length of input and output lines anymore.
- No limit on the maximum number of fields per record.
- Both Unix lex and flex can be used for compilation.

Since no Open Source lex implementation was able to process multibyte
characters at the time the port was done, it was not possible to retain
the regular expression lexer. Regular expressions are thus handled by
the 'Unix Regular Expression Library', which was modified to handle the
traditional awk expression as well. Please contact me if you still find
differences.
