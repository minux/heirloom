Notes for the 'nawk' utility
============================

Changes since the version published by Caldera in OS Utilities 0.1a
(<http://unixtools.sourceforge.net/>) include:

- The lex part of the code can be built with both Unix lex and flex.
- Support for multibyte characters.
- Proper support for LC_TIME (locale-specifix radix character recognized
  in input data, but not in scripts).
- No line length limitations on input and output data.
- No limit on the number of fields per record.

4.4BSD old awk and Brian W. Kernighan's 'One True awk' (available at
<http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/index.html>) have been used as
reference for some of the changes; in addition, the manual page
enclosed here has been derived from 'One True awk' since Caldera
did not enclose one.
