.TH MKDIR 1 "1/24/05" "Heirloom Toolchest" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
mkdir \- make a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkdir\fR [\fB\-m\fI\ mode\fR] [\fB\-p\fR] \fIdirname\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mkdir
creates specified directories in mode 777,
taking the file creation mask into account (see
.IR umask (2)).
Standard entries, `.', for the directory itself,
and `..'  for its parent, are made automatically.
.PP
Mkdir requires write permission in the parent directory.
.PP
The following options are accepted:
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImode\fP
Uses the given
.I mode
to create the directory,
ignoring the file creation mask.
.I Mode
can be given in octal or in symbolic form,
as described in
.IR chmod (1).
The set-group-ID bit is ignored
when present in an octal mode.
.TP
.B \-p
Creates any missing parent directories.
If the
.B \-m
option is also present,
newly created parent directories have the specified mode
with
.BR /usr/5bin/mkdir ;
with
.BR /usr/5bin/s42/mkdir ,
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/mkdir ,
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix2001/mkdir ,
the default mode minus umask plus write and execute permission
for the invoking user is always applied.
.PP
If the set-group-ID bit is set on the parent directory
of a newly created directory,
it is inherited regardless of the
.B \-m
option
unless explicitly specified as a symbolic mode with `+' or `\-'.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
chmod(1),
rmdir(1),
mkdir(2),
umask(2)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Mkdir returns exit code 0
if all directories were successfully made.
Otherwise it prints a diagnostic
and returns nonzero.
