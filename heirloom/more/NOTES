Notes for the more utility
==========================

The more utility provided here is essentially the 4.3BSD version with
added support for System V more features, multibyte locales, lines of
arbitrary length and backspace sequence filtering for searches. There
is no POSIX.2 version provided here; POSIX.2 decided to standardize a
derivative of the less utility and call it more. Since less is not
part of any traditional System V Unix system, it is somewhat beyond
the scope of this collection; moreover, since less is a maintained
open source project, it seems not really necessary to provide a
stripped-down derivative here.

Thus if you need a POSIX.2 variant of more, you should use less. But
if you desperately want to have the 4.4BSD more/less utility in the
Heirloom Toolchest, you're invited to contribute your own port of it.
