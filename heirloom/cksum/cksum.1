.SH NAME
cksum \- write file checksums and sizes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcksum\fR [\fIfile\fR\ .\ .\ .\ ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cksum
calculates and prints a checksum for each named
.IR file ,
and also prints the number of bytes in the file.
It is typically used to look for bad spots, or
to validate a file communicated over
some transmission line.
The CRC used is based on the polynomial used for CRC error
checking in the ISO/IEC 8802-3:1992 Ethernet standard.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
sum(1),
wc(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
`Read error'
is indistinguishable from end of file on
most devices; check the block count.
