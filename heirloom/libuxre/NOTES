Notes for the modified 'UNIX(R) Regular Expression Library'
============================================================

The code this is based on was released by Caldera as 'osutils-0.1a'
and is available at <http://unixtools.sourceforge.net/>. Notable
changes include:

- Support for multibyte characters was enabled again.
- Support for traditional extended regular expression syntax was added.
- Fix: With REG_ICASE, [B-z] matches 'A', 'a', and '[' according to
  POSIX.2.
- Some speed improvements.
