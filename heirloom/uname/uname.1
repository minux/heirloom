.SH NAME
uname \- get system name
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBuname\fR [\fB\-amnprsv\fR]
.sp
\fBuname\fR [\fB\-S\fI system_name\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uname
command prints the name of the system implementation,
or, depending on its options, one of the following:
.TP
.B \-a
All available information.
.TP
.B \-m
The name of the hardware type.
.TP
.B \-n
The node name of this computer.
.TP
.B \-p
Processor type.
.TP
.B \-r
Release level of the system implementation.
.TP
.B \-s
Name of the system implementation.
.TP
.B \-v
Version level of the system implementation.
.PP
If \fB\-S\fI\ system_name\fR is specified,
the node name is changed to
.IR system_name .
This requires appropriate privilege.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.B SYSV3
If set to the empty string,
the output of
.I \-s
is the same as that of
.IR \-n ,
and the output of
.IR \-r ,
.IR \-v ,
and
.I \-m
is set to the fixed values `3.2', `2', and `i386', respectively.
Otherwise, it is interpreted as the six fields
.IP
\fIos\fB,\fIsysname\fB,\fInodename\fB,\fIrelease\fB,\fIversion\fB,\fImachine\fR
.IP
where
.I os
is ignored,
and the other fields specify the output for
.IR \-s ,
.IR \-n ,
.IR \-r ,
.IR \-v ,
and
.IR \-m .
If fewer than six fields are given,
remaining parts of the output are not changed.
This variable also causes the output of
.I \-p
not to be printed with
.IR \-a .
