.SH NAME
cp \- copy files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcp\fR
[\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-i\fR] [\fB\-p\fR]
[\fB\-r\fR\ |\ \fB\-R\fR]
\fIfile1\fR [\fIfile2\fR .\ .\ .\ ] \fItarget\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I File1
is copied onto
.IR target .
If
.I target
is an existing regular file,
its content is overwritten.
Its mode and owner are preserved;
the mode of the source file is used otherwise.
.PP
If
.I target
is a directory,
one or more files are copied
into the directory with their original file-names.
.PP
.B Cp
refuses to copy a file onto itself.
.PP
The
.B cp
command accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-f
If overwriting a target file fails,
.B cp
will try to unlink that file and proceed.
Overrides the
.B \-i
option in
.B /usr/5bin/s42/cp
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/cp .
.TP
.B \-i
.B Cp
will ask for confirmation
before overwriting an existing target.
For
.BR /usr/5bin/cp ,
this flag will be automatically disabled
if standard input is not a terminal.
Overrides the
.B \-f
option in
.B /usr/5bin/s42/cp
and
.BR /usr/5bin/posix/cp .
.TP
.B \-p
.B Cp
will try to preserve access and modification times,
user and group ownerships
and file permission bits.
Failing to preserve these modes
is always considered an error,
but only
.B /usr/5bin/s42/cp
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix/cp
will print an error message.
.TP
.B \-R
The source file operands may be directories
that will be copied recursively.
Special files
such as block and character devices,
FIFOs,
and symbolic links encountered during traversal
are recreated in the target hierarchy.
If a symbolic link is given as an operand,
its target is copied.
.TP
.B \-r
The source file operands may be directories
that will be copied recursively.
Symbolic links are followed.
The content of all non-directory files encountered
is tried to be reproduced in a regular file.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
cat(1),
cpio(1),
mv(1),
pr(1),
rm(1)
.SH NOTES
Use either
.RS
.sp
.B cp
.B \-\-
.I \-file
.I target
.sp
.RE
or
.RS
.sp
.B cp
.I ./-file
.I target
.sp
.RE
to copy files that begin with a hyphen character.
.PP
Files copied with
.B cp
will lose all hard link connection.
Use
.IR cpio (1)
to copy while retaining hard links.
.PP
A copy of a symbolic link
contains the same pathname as the original.
Symbolic links with relative pathnames
may thus change or lose their target
if copied to a different level in the file hierarchy.
