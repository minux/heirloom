.TH TEST 1 "7/2/05" "Heirloom Toolchest" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
test \- condition command
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtest\fR [\fIexpr\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I test
evaluates the expression
.IR expr ,
and if its value is true then returns zero exit status; otherwise, a
non zero exit status is returned.
.I test
returns a non zero exit if there are no arguments.
.PP
The following primitives are used to construct
.IR expr :
.TP 12n
.BR \-r " file"
true if the file exists and is readable.
.TP
.BR \-w " file"
true if the file exists and is writable.
.TP
.BR \-u " file"
true if the file exists and has the setuid bit set.
.TP
.BR \-g " file"
true if the file exists and has the setgid bit set.
.TP
.BR \-k " file"
true if the file exists and has the sticky bit set.
.TP
.BR \-f " file"
true if the file exists and is a regular file.
.TP
.BR \-d " file"
true if the file exists and is a directory.
.TP
.BR \-h " file"
true if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
.TP
.BR \-L " file"
true if the file exists and is a symbolic link.
.TP
.BR \-p " file"
true if the file exists and is a named pipe.
.TP
.BR \-b " file"
true if the file exists and is a block device.
.TP
.BR \-c " file"
true if the file exists and is a character device.
.TP
.BR \-S " file"
true if the file exists and is a socket
.RB ( /usr/5bin/posix/test
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix2001/test
only).
.TP
.BR \-e " file"
true if the file exists
.RB ( /usr/5bin/posix/test
and
.B /usr/5bin/posix2001/test
only).
.TP
.BR \-s " file"
true if the file exists and has a size greater than zero.
.TP
.BR \-t " [fildes]"
true if the open file whose file descriptor number is
.I fildes
(1 by default)
is associated with a terminal device.
.TP
.BR \-z " s1"
true if the length of string
.I s1
is zero.
.TP
.BR \-n " s1"
true if the length of the string
.I s1
is nonzero.
.TP
.RB s1 " = " s2
true
if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are equal.
.TP
.RB s1 " != " s2
true
if the strings
.I s1
and
.I s2
are not equal.
.TP
s1
true if 
.I s1
is not the null string.
.TP
.RB n1 " \-eq " n2
true if the integers
.I n1
and
.I n2
are algebraically equal.
Any of the comparisons
.BR \-ne ,
.BR \-gt ,
.BR \-ge ,
.BR \-lt ,
or
.BR \-le
may be used in place of
.BR \-eq .
.PP
These primaries may be combined with the
following operators:
.TP 12n
.B  !
unary negation operator
.TP
.B  \-a
binary
.I and
operator
.TP
.B  \-o
binary
.I or
operator
.TP
.TP 
.BR "( " "expr" " )"
parentheses for grouping.
.PP 
.B \-a
has higher precedence than
.B \-o.
Notice that all the operators and flags are separate
arguments to
.IR test .
Notice also that parentheses are meaningful
as command separators and must be escaped.
