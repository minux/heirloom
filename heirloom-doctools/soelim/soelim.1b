.SH NAME
soelim \- (BSD) eliminate \&.so's from nroff input
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/usr/ucb/soelim\fR [\fIfile\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Soelim
reads the specified files or the standard input and performs the textual
inclusion implied by the
.I nroff
directives of the form
.PP
.DT
	\&.so somefile
.PP
when they appear at the beginning of input lines.
This is useful since programs such as
.I tbl
do not normally do this;
it allows the placement of individual tables
in separate files to be run as a part of a large document.
.PP
Note that inclusion can be suppressed by using
`\'' instead of `\.', i.e.
.PP
.DT
	\'so /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/s
.PP
A sample usage of
.I soelim
would be
.PP
	soelim exum?.n | tbl | nroff \-ms | col | lp

.SH NOTES
The format of the source commands must involve no strangeness \-
exactly one
blank must precede and no blanks follow the file name.
