README for the Heirloom Troff Demonstration Page
================================================

To build this document, you either need the Type 1 Adobe
Caslon font including the Expert sets, or its OpenType
variant Adobe Caslon Pro, and need to set the TROFFONTS
variable accordingly. Adobe Caslon Pro is available as
part of the "Adobe Type Basics OpenType Edition" package.

Note that as of autumn 2005, it was not possible to
download fonts bought directly from Adobe using a Linux
system. There are many other shops that sell Adobe fonts,
though, and these usually allow downloads for Linux users.
