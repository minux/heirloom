.SH DESCRIPTION
.I troff
formats text in the named
.I files
for printing on phototypesetter devices.
Its capabilities are described in the
.I Nroff/Troff user's manual.
.PP
.I troff
generates output in an ASCII format
which requires a device-dependent postprocessor
before it can be printed;
see the description of the
.I \-T
option
and the example
below.
.PP
If no
.I file
argument is present, the standard input is read.
An argument consisting of a single minus
.RB ( \- )
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
.TP "\w'\f3\-F\f1fontdir 'u"
.BI \-o list
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in
the comma-separated
.I list
of numbers and ranges.
A range
.IB N \- M
means pages
.I N
through
.IR M ;
an initial
.I \-N
means
from the beginning to page
.IR N ;
and a final
.IR N \-
means
from
.I N
to the end.
.TP
.BI \-n N
Number first generated page
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-s N
Stop every
.I N
pages.
.I Nroff
will halt prior to every
.I N
pages (default
.IR N =1)
to allow paper loading or
changing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
.I Troff
will stop the phototypesetter every
.I N
pages,
produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and resume when the typesetter's start button is pressed.
.TP
.BI \-m name
Prepend the macro file
.BI /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/tmac. name
to the input
.IR files .
.TP
.BI \-r aN
Set register
.I a
(one-character) to
.IR N .
.TP
.B \-i
Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.TP
.B \-z
Check syntax only;
do not generate any output
except for error messages.
.TP
.BI \-F fontdir
Use the directory
.I fontdir
to locate font files.
.TP
.B \-u N
Set the emboldening amount,
i.e. the number of times a character is printed
to simulate bold output,
to
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-T device
Prepare output for the specified device.
Available
.I devices
are:
.RS
.TP 8n
.B ps
for PostScript output with 72,000\ dpi
and AFM font metrics (default),
also with
.I dpost
as postprocessor
.TP
.B psmed
for PostScript output with 3,600\ dpi
and AFM font metrics,
also with
.I dpost
as postprocessor
.TP
.B pslow
for PostScript output with 432\ dpi
and AFM font metrics,
also with
.I dpost
as postprocessor
.TP
.B post
for PostScript output with 720\ dpi,
with
.I dpost
as postprocessor
.TP
.B aps
for the Autologic APS-5,
with
.I daps
as postprocessor
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Refrain from feeding out paper and stopping
phototypesetter at the end of the run.
.TP
.B \-a
Send a printable text-only approximation
of the results to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-x
Enable all extensions,
even those that likely cause compatibility problems
with previous versions of
.IR troff .
.TP
.B \-X
Disable any extensions.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping
of bytes to characters.
.TP
.B TYPESETTER
Specifies a device name as with the
.I \-T
option.
.TP
.B TROFFONTS
A colon-separated list of directory names
to search for PostScript fonts
before the device font directory.
.TP
.B TROFFMACS
Specifies the location to search for macro files with the
.I \-m
option.
This string forms a prefix to which the macro package name
is immediately appended.
Thus to make `\-mname' work with a file `/path/to/tmac.name',
use `TROFFMACS=/path/to/tmac.'
.SH FILES
.ta \w'/usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/*  'u
/tmp/ta*	temporary file
.br
/usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/*	standard macro files
.br
/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/*	font width tables
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate a PostScript file
from input that contains equations and tables, use
.RS
.nf
.sp
<input tbl | eqn | troff | dpost >output.ps
.sp
.fi
.RE
The resulting file can then be sent to a printer,
displayed by a previewer,
or changed by further postprocessing utilities.
