.SH DESCRIPTION
.I nroff
formats text in the named
.I files
for typewriter-like devices.
Its capabilities are described in the
.I Nroff/Troff user's manual.
.PP
If no
.I file
argument is present, the standard input is read.
An argument consisting of a single minus
.RB ( \- )
is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
.TP "\w'\f3\-F\f1fontdir 'u"
.BI \-o list
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in
the comma-separated
.I list
of numbers and ranges.
A range
.IB N \- M
means pages
.I N
through
.IR M ;
an initial
.I \-N
means
from the beginning to page
.IR N ;
and a final
.IR N \-
means
from
.I N
to the end.
.TP
.BI \-n N
Number first generated page
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-s N
Stop every
.I N
pages.
.I Nroff
will halt prior to every
.I N
pages (default
.IR N =1)
to allow paper loading or
changing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
.I Troff
will stop the phototypesetter every
.I N
pages,
produce a trailer to allow changing cassettes,
and resume when the typesetter's start button is pressed.
.TP
.BI \-m name
Prepend the macro file
.BI /usr/ucblib/doctools/tmac/tmac. name
to the input
.IR files .
.TP
.BI \-r aN
Set register
.I a
(one-character) to
.IR N .
.TP
.B \-i
Read standard input after the input files are exhausted.
.TP
.B \-q
Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the
.B rd
request.
.TP
.B \-z
Check syntax only;
do not generate any output
except for error messages.
.TP
.BI \-F fontdir
Use the directory
.I fontdir
to locate font files.
.TP
.B \-u N
Set the emboldening amount,
i.e. the number of times a character is printed
to simulate bold output,
to
.IR N .
.TP
.BI \-T name
Prepare output for specified terminal.
Known
.I names
are
.B 37
for the (default) 
Teletype Corporation Model 37 terminal,
.B lp
for any line printer or terminal without half-line capability,
.B tn300
for the GE TermiNet\ 300,
.B 300S
for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300S,
.B 300
for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300,
and
.B 450
for the \s-1DASI\s+1-450
(Diablo Hyterm).
A special
.IR name ,
.BR locale ,
is also supported.
It generates UTF-8 output if permitted by
the current locale,
and has the same effect as
.I lp
otherwise.
.TP
.B \-e
Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted
lines, using full terminal resolution.
.TP
.B \-h
Use output tabs during horizontal spacing
to speed output and reduce output character count.
Tab settings are assumed to be every
8 nominal character widths.
.TP
.B \-x
Enable extended requests
that may cause compatibility problems
with previous versions of nroff.
.TP
.B \-X
Disable extended requests (default).
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping
of bytes to characters,
and the choice of output characters with the
.I \-Tlocale
option.
.TP
.B TYPESETTER
Specifies a device name as with the
.I \-T
option.
.TP
.B TROFFMACS
Specifies the location to search for macro files with the
.I \-m
option.
This string forms a prefix to which the macro package name
is immediately appended.
Thus to make `\-mname' work with a file `/path/to/tmac.name',
use `TROFFMACS=/path/to/tmac.'
