Adding hyphenation files to troff
=================================

There are principally two methods to obtain hyphenation files for
use with troff:

1. Get an OpenOffice hyphenation file. The file format of these should
   be principally compatible; however, the results when hyphenating with
   them were rather mediocre. I have not followed this issue further.

2. Derive a hyphenation file from TeX sources in the following steps:

   a) Verify that you are allowed to do this by reading the license of
      the individual file.

   b) Create a temporary copy of the file for the next steps.

   c) Delete everything except the \patterns{} and \hyphenation{} parts;
      the latter may be missing.

   d) Recode the \hyphenation{} part, if any, to the same format as the
      \patterns{} part. Replace each hyphen by a "9", and insert an "8"
      after any letter that is not followed by a hyphen. The first and
      last characters of each word are not hyphenated anyway, so there
      is no need to insert an "8" there. Surround each word by dots. In
      effect, "phil-an-thropic" becomes ".ph8i8l9a8n9t8h8r8o8p8ic."

   e) Delete remaining part separators, if any.

   f) Reformat the file such that each pattern is on a single line, and
      delete any other white space.

   g) Replace any non-ASCII characters in one of the TeX encodings by
      their ISO-8859-1 equivalents. If this is not possible, delete the
      individual pattern (or contact me if you are willing and feel able
      to contribute support for hyphenation of other encodings to troff).

   h) Run "perl substring.pl tmp_file". This will print a lot of output,
      and will finally generate the file "hyphen.mashed". Move it to
      "hyph_<lc>_<CC>[@extra].dic", where "lc" is a language code, and
      "CC" is a country code, as appropriate. The optional "@extra" part
      may be added to describe special variations.

   i) Add the line "ISO8859-1" as the first line of the new file.

   j) Insert copyright/authorship statements from the original file into
      the new one using "%" as a comment character. Supply any information
      that is additionally demanded by the license of the original.

   k) Insert a prominent remark that you changed the file, and that you
      will accept bug reports for your variant.

   l) Contribute your work if you like.
