.SH NAME
tbl \- (BSD) format tables for nroff or troff
.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fB\-me\fR|\fB\-mm\fR|\fB\-ms\fR] [\fIfiles\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tbl
is a preprocessor for formatting tables for
.I nroff
or
.IR troff .
The input files are copied to the standard output,
except for lines between .TS and .TE
command lines, which are assumed to describe tables
and reformatted.
With the
.I \-mx
options, the respective macro packages
are copied to the beginning of the output.
Details are given in the reference manual.

As an example, letting \\t represent a tab (which should
be typed as a genuine tab)

If no arguments are given,
.I tbl
reads the standard input,
so it may be used as a filter.
When it is used with
.I eqn
or
.I neqn
the
.I tbl
command should be first, to minimize the volume
of data passed through
pipes.
.PP
.I tbl
normally uses line drawing commands with repeated
underline and box rule characters
(i.e.
.I troff
\el and \eL).
With the
.B \-g
option,
graphic drawing commands (i.e. \eD) are used instead.
