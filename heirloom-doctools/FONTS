Font handling in troff with PostScript devices
==============================================

The basics
----------

Heirloom troff understands two ways to select PostScript fonts.

The new method can access PostScript font files directly. Fonts are
selected using a new request that is only available with "troff -x":

  .fpost r yy basename [pfb|pfa|t42]
	reads metrics from the file "fontdir/afm/basename.afm". The font
	is then available with ".ft yy", "\f(yy", etc. "yy" may be freely
	chosen. The "r" argument specifies a register on which the font
	is to be mounted. If it is zero or too large, the font is mounted
	on a free position (not on position zero). Contrasting to the
	".fp" request, the "r" argument may consist of more than a single
	digit.
	  "yy" may be the name of an existing ditroff-style font, such
	as "R". In this case, the same register must be reused. For best
	compatibility with conventional troff usage, it is recommended
	that the base fonts of a document are mounted as "1 R", "2 I".
	The initial fonts on positions 9 (S1) and 10 (S) should not be
	changed, as these contain special metrics for drawing commands.
	  If the optional "pfb|pfa|t42" argument is present, data from
	the file "fontdir/pfb/basename.pfb" (or pfa/t42, respectively)
	is included into the generated PostScript. This is useful to
	include fonts that have not yet been downloaded into the
	printer, or for generating PDFs with additional fonts.

As an example,
      
	.fpost 0 VA van_____ pfb
	.ft VA
	Here is some text in Monotype Van Dijck Regular.

The new default higher-resolution "7200" PostScript device always uses
this method; it supports the conventional ".fp" request for backwards
compatibility to select pre-installed fonts from the PDF base set.

With fonts selected by this method, localized input processing is
performed according to the LC_CTYPE environment variable, or according
to a document-specific value set by the new ".lc_ctype" request. Note
that your terminal and text editor/pager must support UTF-8 to display
the following example properly:

	.\" de_DE.utf8 is for GNU libc; de_DE.UTF-8 may work elsewhere.
	.lc_ctype de_DE.utf8
	Deutscher Text mit „Anführungszeichen“
	.sp
	The first five small letters of the Greek alphabet: α β γ δ ε

The old ditroff method requires font tables to be generated manually.
It is still supported, and is still the default for the lower-resolution
"post" PostScript device, but it is not recommended anymore that it is
used for adding fonts. Localized input processing according to LC_CTYPE
is not available with this method.


Installing fonts
----------------

Making additional fonts available is easy with the new method. If you
buy a PostScript Type 1 font for use with troff, select the Windows
version. You will get a set of files from the vendor. Only two of them
are of interest for troff:

  xxxxxxxx.afm
	This is the metrics file. troff accesses it to learn the widths
	of characters in the font. Put this file (or a symbolic link to
	it) into the directory /usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev7200/afm.

  xxxxxxxx.pfb
	This file contains the actual glyph data. troff does not really
	need this file, but your printer or PDF converter does. In many
	cases, it is most convenient to include the data directly into
	the .ps file generated. Put the file (or a symbolic link to it)
	into the directory /usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev7200/pfb.

For TrueType fonts, an additional conversion step is necessary. troff
cannot handle TrueType fonts directly, but it can handle PostScript
Type 42 fonts, which are a special representation of them. You can
use the "ttftot42" utility from <http://www.nih.at/ttftot42/> to
generate a Type 42 font from a TrueType font. It will produce a .afm
file, which you need to put into /usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev7200/afm
as for a Type 1 font, and a .t42 file, which troff expects to find in
/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev7200/t42. You can then use the Type 42
font just like a Type 1 font. The only drawback with this is that a
Type 42 font requires special support from the PostScript interpreter;
an aging printer may not be able to process them.


Using fonts with old style numerals
-----------------------------------

A font with old style numerals but otherwise standard characters usually
does not require any special mechanism. It can simply be mounted, selected,
and used.


Using fonts with small capital letters
--------------------------------------

Small capital fonts normally need letter space tracking. Thus e.g.
to use the Stempel Garamond small capital font, write something like

	.fpost 0 SC gsrsc___ pfb
	.tkf SC 1 .2 24 2
	.ft SC
	This text prints in Small Capitals.


Using a combination of expert and standard fonts for small capitals
-------------------------------------------------------------------

An expert font contains small capital letters but no upper-case capital
letters. Since it would be very inconvenient to change the font
explicitly for each upper-case letter, the fallback sequence is useful
in this case. The expert font is selected as text font, but for each
upper-case letter encountered, troff changes automatically to the
standard font. An example with the Monotype Fournier type:

	.fpost 1 R fn______ pfb
	.fpost 0 E fny_____ pfb
	.tkf E 1 .2 24 2
	.fallback E R
	.ft E
	This text prints in Small Capitals.


Using a combination of expert and standard fonts for old style numerals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This also uses the fallback sequence, but since the standard numerals
are present in the standard font, they have to be hidden first so that
troff does not select them:

	.fpost 1 R fn______ pfb
	.fpost 0 E fny_____ pfb
	.fallback R E
	.hidechar R 0123456789
	The numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are in old style.


Using the expert font for both small capitals and old style numerals
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The examples above can also be combined. Since the .tkf request does not
affect the tracking of fonts that are selected by the fallback sequence,
it is sufficient to mount each font once:

	.fpost 1 R fn______ pfb
	.fpost 0 E fny_____ pfb
	.fallback R E
	.fallback E R
	.tkf E 1 .2 24 2
	.hidechar R 0123456789
	The numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are in old style.
	.br
	.ft E
	But this text prints in Small Capitals.


Combining different fonts
-------------------------

Different fonts often have different visual sizes even if they are set
in the same nominal point size. To adjust this, the ".fzoom" request
is available. It only applies to characters that are actually in the
current font, not to characters from another font that have been
selected using the fallback sequence.

	.fpost 1 R pl______ pfb
	.fpost 6 H hv______
	.fzoom H .92
	Text in \fHHelvetica\fP must be adjusted to fit with Plantin.


Limitations
-----------

troff can currently only access the first 255 characteres defined
in an AFM file. This is sufficient for traditional PostScript fonts
which almost uniformly contain fewer characters, but limits the use
of internationalized fonts. If only a few characters need to be
accessed, it is possible reorder the character entry lines in the
AFM file to work around.
