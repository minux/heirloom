.SH NAME
addbib \- (BSD) create or extend bibliographic database
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/usr/ucb/addbib\fR
[\fB\-p\fI\ promptfile\fR] [\fB\-a\fR] \fIdatabase\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
When this program starts up, answering ``y''
to the initial ``Instructions?'' prompt yields directions;
typing ``n'' or \s-2RETURN\s0 skips them.
.I Addbib
then prompts for various bibliographic fields,
reads responses from the terminal,
and sends output records to a
.I database.
A null response (just \s-2RETURN\s0) means to leave out that field.
A minus sign (\-) means to go back to the previous field.
A trailing backslash allows a field to be continued on the next line.
The repeating ``Continue?'' prompt allows the user
either to resume by typing ``y'' or \s-2RETURN\s0,
to quit the current session by typing ``n'' or ``q'',
or to edit the
.I database
with any system editor \fI(vi, ex, edit, ed).\fP
.PP
The
.B \-a
option suppresses prompting for an abstract;
asking for an abstract is the default.
Abstracts are ended with a \s-2CTRL\s0-d.
The
.B \-p
option causes
.I addbib
to use a new prompting skeleton, defined in
.I promptfile.
This file should contain prompt strings, a tab,
and the key-letters to be written to the
.I database.
.PP
The most common key-letters and their meanings are given below.
.I Addbib
insulates you from these key-letters,
since it gives you prompts in English,
but if you edit the bibliography file later on,
you will need to know this information.
