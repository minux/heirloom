README for the Heirloom Troff Font Handling Manual
==================================================

To build this manual, you need the Garamond Premier Pro
Opticals fonts from Adobe, and need to set the TROFFONTS
variable accordingly.

Note that as of autumn 2005, it was not possible to
download fonts bought directly from Adobe using a Linux
system. There are many other shops that sell Adobe fonts,
though, and these usually allow downloads for Linux users.
