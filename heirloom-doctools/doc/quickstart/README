README for the Heirloom Troff Quickstart Guide
==============================================

To build this document, you need the Myriad Pro fonts
from Adobe, and need to set the TROFFONTS variable
accordingly. Myriad Pro is available as part of the
"Adobe Type Basics OpenType Edition" package.

Note that as of autumn 2005, it was not possible to
download fonts bought directly from Adobe using a Linux
system. There are many other shops that sell Adobe fonts,
though, and these usually allow downloads for Linux users.
