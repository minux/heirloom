README for the Heirloom Documentation Tools Reference Manual
============================================================

To build the reference manual, you need to download the
OpenType variants of TeX Gyre Termes fonts available for
free from <http://www.janusz.nowacki.strefa.pl/>, and
to set the TROFFONTS variable such that it includes them.
