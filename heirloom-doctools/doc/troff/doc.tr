Introduction
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are text processors under
the \s-1UNIX\s+1 Time-Sharing System\*u1\*d
that format text for typewriter-like terminals and
for a typesetter/raster devices, respectively.
They accept lines of text interspersed with lines of
format control information and
format the text into a printable, paginated document
having a user-designed style.
\*(NR and \*(TR offer
unusual freedom in document styling,
including:
arbitrary style headers and footers;
arbitrary style footnotes;
multiple automatic sequence numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc;
multiple column output;
dynamic font and point-size control;
arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point;
and
a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and
line drawing functions.
.pg
\*(TR produces its output in a device-independent form,
although parameterized for a specific device;
\*(TR output must be processed by a driver for that
device to produce printed output.
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are highly compatible with each other and it is almost always
possible to prepare input acceptable to both.
Conditional input is provided that enables
the user to embed input expressly destined for either program.
\*(NR can prepare output directly for a variety of terminal types and
is capable of utilizing the full resolution of each terminal.
.pg
.ft B
On the Heirloom Documentation Tools Edition
.pg
In Summer 2005, Sun Microsystems, Inc. released
the source code to the Solaris system,
including the System\ V Release\ 4 version of \*[TR,]
a derivative of AT\[ampersand]T
\fIDocumenter's Workbench\fR \*[TR,] version 2.
It had undergone few changes since the end of the 1980's,
so it could serve as a clean starting point
for a new version of \*(TR
which is intended to be highly compatible
with \s-1UNIX\s+1 \*[TR,]
but which also provides additional features
desirable for a high-quality typesetting application
at the beginning of the 21st century.
.pg
As with the other components of the \fIHeirloom Project,\fR
the original code,
once it had been released under an Open Source license,
has been made portable such that it compiles and runs
on the contemporary \s-1UNIX\s+1-style systems, including Linux.
It continues to be freely available under the same license
as originally released, including its complete source code.
.pg
\*(PS and its close relative \*[PDF]
are now the only device languages
which are relevant to high-quality printing;
actually, \*(PS itself is more and more becoming
an intermediate language for the generation of \*[PDF] documents.
The \fIHeirloom\fR version of \*(TR is thus primarily directed
towards generating \*(PS output
for further processing by a \*[PDF] creator,
such as Ghostscript or Adobe Distiller;
it can generate \*[PDF]-specific instructions
for prepress usage
as well as for online navigation in \*[PDF] documents.
.pg
The principal output device independence of \*(TR
has nevertheless been retained,
and changes to the intermediate language have been minor.
Many \*(TR post-processors will thus continue to be usable
with no or little adaptions.
.pg
\*(PS Type\ 1, OpenType, and TrueType
have become device-independent font formats;
virtually all commercial and free fonts
are available in one of them.
There is thus no need for a \*(TR-specific device-independent font format
anymore;
instead, \fIHeirloom\fR \*(TR can read font metrics directly
from Type\ 1, OpenType, and TrueType font files.
This has greatly relieved the task of installing fonts\(emit
suffices to copy the original files to a user-selectable font directory\(em,
and makes it possible to access advanced typographic data,
such as kerning tables or substitution instructions for old-style numerals.
.pg
\*(TR provides convenient access to
any character in a font file
either by its \*(PS name,
by its Unicode position
as specified in a font-specific or a generic table,
or by conversion from \s-1POSIX\s+1-style locale-specific characters
to Unicode positions.
The last form allows direct input of international language texts
in almost any character encoding,
including \s-1UTF\s+1-8.
.pg
A variety of international paper formats
and hyphenation languages are supported by \*[TR.]
.pg
Many internal limitations of \*(TR have been removed;
most notably, \*(TR can now set characters in fractional point sizes.
.pg
The \*(TR language has been extended
similarly as in the \s-1GNU\s+1 version of \*[TR,] \fIgroff\fR\|\*u6\*d;
for example,
names of requests, macros, strings, number registers, and fonts
can consist of more than two characters.
However, \fIHeirloom\fR \*(TR is not generally compatible with \fIgroff,\fR
although adaption of \fIgroff\fR documents is often possible.
.pg
As even the most basic printing devices
are now capable of rastering \*(PS documents
(at least using conversion tools),
and as \*(PS and \*[PDF] viewer programs allow
an accurate on-screen display of \*(TR documents,
there is only one area where \*(NR is still useful:
the formatting of \s-1UNIX\s+1 manual pages.
The \fIHeirloom\fR version of \*(NR
is thus specifically aimed at this task;
it remains a separate program,
is much smaller than \*[TR,]
and is optionally able to run without external device description files.
This makes it possible to use it to view manual pages
even on small system distributions
where the size of programs is an issue.
.pg
The Solaris version of \*(NR had already been updated
to support input characters in arbitrary locales.
The \fIHeirloom\fR version adds the ability to generate
\s-1UTF\s+1-8 output.
This extends the \*(NR character set
by many mathematical and typographical characters
on terminals capable of displaying them.
.pg
Although \fIHeirloom\fR \*(NR does of course
not provide the typographical extensions made for \*[TR,]
it includes the same language extensions.
It is thus well able to cope with the
tangle of manual page code
which has been produced by application writers
who have unfortunately become increasingly unaware
of how to write well-styled \*(NR documents.
.pg
This manual as well as some of the pre- and post-processor commands
have been derived from \s-1UNIX\s+1 code re\%leased by Caldera\*u7\*d,
and from materials released by Lucent as parts
of the \fIPlan\ 9\fR system\*u8\*d.
.pg
.ft B
Background to the Second Edition
.pg
\*(TR
was originally written by the late Joe Ossanna
in about 1973, in assembly language for the \s-1PDP\s+1-11,
to drive the Graphic Systems CAT typesetter.
It was rewritten in C around 1975,
and underwent slow but steady evolution until
Ossanna's death late in 1977.
.pg
In 1979, Brian Kernighan
modified
\*(TR
so that it would produce output for a variety of typesetters,
while retaining its input specifications.
Over the decade from 1979 to 1989,
the internals
have been modestly revised,
though much of the code remains as it was when Ossanna wrote it.
.pg
\*(TR
reads parameter files
each time it is invoked, to
set values for machine resolution,
legal type sizes and fonts, and character names,
character widths
and the like.
\*(TR
output is \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters
in a simple language
that describes where each character is to be placed
and in what size and font.
A post-processor must be written for each device
to convert this typesetter-independent language
into specific instructions for that device.
.pg
The output language contains information that was not readily
identifiable in the older output.
In the newer language, the beginning of each page, line, and word
is marked,
so post-processors can do device-specific optimizations
such as sorting the data vertically or printing it boustrophedonically,
independent of
\*[TR.]
.pg
Capabilities for graphics have been added:
\*(TR
recognizes commands for drawing diagonal lines,
circles, ellipses, circular arcs,
and quadratic B-splines.
There are also ways to pass arbitrary information to the output,
unprocessed by
\*[TR.]
.pg
A number of limitations have been eased or eliminated.
A document may have an arbitrary number of fonts on any page
(if the output device permits it, of course).
Fonts may be accessed merely by naming them;
``mounting'' is no longer necessary.
There are no limits on the number of characters.
\H'8'Character height\H'10' and \S'-1'sl\S'0'a\S'1'nt\S'0' may be set
independently of width.
.pg
The remainder of this document contains a description of
usage and command-line options;
a summary of requests, escape sequences, and pre-defined number registers;
a reference manual;
tutorial examples;
and a list of commonly-available characters.

Acknowledgements (for the Second Edition, by Brian Kernighan)
.pg
Joe Ossanna's
\*(TR
remains a remarkable accomplishment.
For more than twenty years, it has proven a robust tool,
taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors
and being forced into uses that were never conceived of
in the original design,
all with considerable grace under fire.
.pg
Recent versions of \*(TR have profited from
significant code improvements by
Jaap Akkerhuis, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and Molly Wagner.
Andrew Hume, Doug McIlroy, Peter Nelson, and
Ravi Sethi made valuable suggestions on the manual.
I fear that the remaining bugs are my fault.

Acknowledgements (for the Heirloom Edition, by Gunnar Ritter)
.pg
The \*(TR program as written by Joseph Ossanna and Brian Kernighan
turned out to be an excellent base
for a typesetting system containing
approximately twice as many lines of code.
As with the second edition,
the design and the principal parts of \*(TR have remained the same,
despite of additions and modifications.
This is particularly remarkable since
much of it is now more than 30 years old,
but serves its purpose as well as on day one.
.pg
I am grateful to Sun, Caldera, and Lucent
for releasing the source code
without which this project would not have been possible.
.pg
I wish to thank Brian Kernighan for the permission
to adapt this manual.

The general form of invoking \*(NR (or \*(TR) at \s-1UNIX\s+1 command level is
.x1
\fBnroff  \fIoptions  files\fR\
\h'|2i'(or  \fBtroff  \fIoptions  files\fR)
.x2
where \fIoptions\fR represents any of a number of option arguments
and \fIfiles\fR represents the list of files containing the document
to be formatted.
An argument consisting of a single minus (\fB\-\fR) is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
If no file names are given input is taken from the standard input.

	\fB\-o\fIlist\fR	\
Print only pages whose page numbers appear in \fIlist\fR,
which consists of comma-separated numbers and number ranges.
A number range has the form \fIN\-M\fR
and means pages \fIN\fR through \fIM;\fR
a initial \fI\-N\fR means
from the beginning to page \fIN;\fR and a final \fIN\-\fR means
from \fIN\fR to the end.
.bt
	\fB\-n\fIN\fR	Number first generated page \fIN\fR.
.bt
	\fB\-s\fIN\fR	Stop every \fIN\fR pages.
\*(NR will halt prior to every \fIN\fR pages (default \fIN\fR=1)
to allow paper loading or
changing, and will resume upon receipt of a newline.
\*(TR will include a ``pause'' code every \fIN\fR pages;
its meaning, if any, depends on the output device.

lines, using full terminal resolution.
.bt
	\fB\-h\fR	\
Produce equally-spaced words in adjusted lines,
using full terminal resolution.
.bt
	\fB\-T\fIname\fR	Specifies
the name of the output terminal type.
Currently defined names are \fB37\fR for the (default) Model 37 Teletype\(rg,
\fBlp\fR for any line printer or terminal without half-line capability,
\fBtn300\fR for the GE TermiNet\ 300,
\fB300S\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300S,
\fB300\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-300,
and
\fB450\fR for the \s-1DASI\s+1-450 (Diablo Hyterm).
A special names, \fBlocale\fR, is also supported.
It generates \s-1UTF\s+1-8 output if permitted
by the current \s-1LC_CTYPE\s+1 locale,
and has the same effect as \fBlp\fR otherwise.

of the results to the standard output.
.bt
	\fB\-F\fIpath\fR	Look in directory \fIpath\fP
for font information;
the default is \fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps\fP.
.bt
	\fB\-T\fIname\fR	Specifies the output device.
Currently defined names are
\fBps\fR for (default) \*(PS output at 72\|000 dpi,
\fBpsmed\fR for \*(PS output at 3600 dpi,
\fBpslow\fR for \*(PS output at 432 dpi,
and
\fBpost\fR for \*(PS output at 720 dpi with legacy fonts.

Each option is invoked as a separate argument;
for example,
.x1
\fBnroff  \-o\fI4,8\-10  \fB\-T\fI300S  \fB\-m\fIabc  file1  file2\fR
.x2
requests formatting of pages 4, 8, 9, and 10 of a document contained in the files
named \fIfile1\fR and \fIfile2\fR,
specifies the output terminal as a \s-1DASI\s+1-300S,
and invokes the macro package \fIabc\fR.
.pg
Various pre- and post-processors are available for use with \*(NR and \*[TR.]
These include the equation preprocessors \fIneqn\fP and \fIeqn\fP\*u2\*d
(for \*(NR and \*(TR respectively),
the table-construction preprocessor \fItbl\fP\*u3\*d,
and \fIpic\fP and \fIgrap\fP
for various forms of graphics.
A reverse-line postprocessor \fIcol\fP
is available for multiple-column \*(NR output on terminals without reverse-line ability;
\fIcol\fP expects the Model 37 Teletype
escape sequences that \*(NR produces by default.
.pg
The \fBdpost\fR postprocessor has a special role
as it translates \*(TR intermediate output to \*(PS,
which is currently the only relevant target device format.
.pg
For example, in
.x1
\fBtbl  \fIfiles  \fB|  eqn  |  troff  \fIoptions  \fB|  dpost\fR  >\fIoutput.ps\fR
.x2
the first \|\fB|\fR\| indicates the piping of \fItbl's\fP
output to \fIeqn's\fP input;
the second the piping of \fIeqn's\fP output to \*(TR's input;
and the third indicates the piping of \*(TR's output to \fIdpost,\fP
which then writes \*(PS code to \fIoutput.ps\fR.

	\fB\-e\ \fIencoding\fR	\
Set the \*(PS encoding scheme.
Interesting values of \fIencoding\fR are:
\fB0\fR using the \*(PS \fBashow\fR operator,
with the same position representation as previous
versions of \fIdpost\fR;
\fB2\fR using the \*(PS \fBwidthshow\fR operator,
usually resulting in compacter output
unless the \fBtrack\fR request has been used;
\fB4\fR using \fBashow\fR,
storing positions as differences;
\fB5\fR like 4 but using a binary \*(PS Level\~2 representation.
The default is 4.
\fB
.bt
	\fB\-M\ \fImarks\fR	\
Print marks (in combination with the \T'trimat'\fBtrimat\fR\T \*(TR request).
Valid types of \fImarks\fR are:
\fBcutmarks\fR,
\fBregistrationmarks\fR,
\fBstartargets\fR,
\fBcolorbars\fR,
and
\fBall\fR.
Mark names can be abbreviated and combined by colons,
e.g. \fB\-Mcut:reg\fR will print cut marks and registration marks.

In the following table,
the notation \(+-\fIN\fP in the
\fIRequest Form\fR
column means that the forms \fIN\fR, +\fIN\fR, or \-\fIN\fR are permitted,
to set the parameter to \fIN\fR,
increment it by \fIN\fR,
or decrement it by \fIN\fR,
respectively.
Plain \fIN\fP means that the value is used to set the parameter.

General Explanation
.sc
Form of input.
Input consists of \fItext lines\fR, which are destined to be printed,
interspersed with \fIcontrol lines\fR,
which set parameters or otherwise control subsequent processing.
Control lines begin with a \fIcontrol character\fR\(em\
normally \fB.\fR (period) or \fB\'\fR (acute accent)\(em\
followed by a name that specifies
a basic \fIrequest\fR or the substitution of
a user-defined \fImacro\fR in place of the control line.
The control character \fB\'\fR suppresses the \fIbreak\fR function\(em\
the forced output of a partially filled line\(em\
caused by certain requests.
The control character may be separated from the request/macro name by
white space (spaces and/or tabs) for esthetic reasons.
Names must be followed by either
space or newline.
Control lines with unrecognized names are ignored.
.pg
Various special functions may be introduced anywhere in the input by
means of an \fIescape\fR character, normally \fB\e\fR.
For example, the function
\T'e_n'\fB\en\fIR\fR\T
causes the interpolation of the contents of the
\fInumber register R\fR
in place of the function;
here \fIR\fR is either a single character name
as in \fB\en\fIx\fR,
a left-parenthesis-introduced, two-character name as in \fB\en(\fIxx\fR,
or a left-bracket-introduced, multiple character name as in
\fB\en[\fIxxx\fR].
.pg
\A'c_extension'In traditional \*[TR,]
only one and two character names were permitted
for request, macro, string, number register, and font names.
Heirloom \*(TR can accept names containing a (nearly) arbitrary
number of \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters.
By default, request and macro names are still required
to contain at most two characters for compatibility reasons.
The \fB\-x\fR command line option,
the \T'do'\fBdo\fR\T request,
.lg 0
or the \T'xflag'\fBxflag\fR\T request
.lg
make the longer names available.
The current extension level is available in the \A'n_.X'\fB.X\fR register.
.pg
Four levels of extension availability are currently defined:
.de lv
.xx
.in \w'0\ 'u
.ti 0
..
.lv
0\ disables all extensions except for locale-dependent input and
Type\ 1/OpenType/TrueType font selection using \T'fp'\fBfp\fR\T.
.lv
1\ enables extensions except for direct access to long names on
request lines, i.e., \fB&abcde\fR will be interpreted as request
\T'ab'\fBab\fR\T with argument \fBcde\fR. Long names can be accessed using
the \T'do'\fBdo\fR request\T, e.g. \fB&do papersize a4\fR. Long names in
escape sequences are recognized, though, e.g. \fB\e*[xyz]\fR
refers to the string named \fBxyz\fR and not to the string named
\fB[\fR. It is normally the only relevant difference, so input
written for traditional \*(TR can almost always be used
without change in this mode. This level is the default.
.lv
2\ also enables direct access to long names on request lines.
If an undefined long name is read, its first two characters
are interpreted as a short request using the remaining
characters as argument. So if a macro \fBabcde\fR is defined,
\fB&abcde\fR will execute it, but otherwise, \fB&abcde\fR continues
to execute \fBab\fR. String and number register references are
only interpreted if they start in the first two characters
of a name, i.e. no string interpretation is performed on
input \fB&ab\e*(xy\fR.
.lv
3\ ignores undefined long requests even if they form a prefix
of a short request, and interprets string and number register
references in any position of a name.

Formatter and device resolution.
\*(TR internally stores and processes dimensions in units
that correspond to the particular device
for which output is being prepared;
values from 300 to 72\|000/inch are typical.
\T's_device'See \(sc26.\T
\*(NR internally uses 240 units/inch,
corresponding to the least common multiple of the
horizontal and vertical resolutions of various
typewriter-like output devices.
\*(TR rounds horizontal/vertical numerical parameter input to the actual
horizontal/vertical resolution
of the output device indicated by the \fB\-T\fR option (default \fBps\fP).
\*(NR similarly rounds numerical input to the actual resolution
of the output device indicated by the \fB\(miT\fR option
(default Model 37 Teletype).
.sc
\A'c_units'Numerical parameter input.
Both \*(NR and \*(TR

In \*[NR,] \fIboth\fR the em and the en are taken to be equal to the \fIC\fR,
which is output-device dependent;
common values are 1/10 and 1/12 inch.
Actual character widths in \*(NR need not be all the same and constructed characters
such as \(mi> (\(->) are often extra wide.

requests;
and \fBu\fR for the requests
\fB\T'nr'nr\T\fR,
\fB\T'if'if\T\fR,
and
\fB\T'ie'ie\T\fR.
\fIAll\fR other requests ignore any scale indicators.
When a number register containing an already appropriately scaled number
is interpolated to provide numerical input,
the unit scale indicator
\fBu\fR may need to be appended to prevent
an additional inappropriate default scaling.
The number, \fIN\fR, may be specified in decimal-fraction form
but the parameter finally stored is rounded to an integer number of basic units.
.pg
The \fIabsolute position\fR indicator \fB~\fR may be prepended
to a number \fIN\fR
to generate the distance to the vertical or horizontal place \fIN\fR.
For vertically-oriented requests and functions, \fB~\|\fIN\fR
becomes the distance in basic units from the current vertical place on the page or in a \T'c_diversion'\fIdiversion\fR (\(sc7.4)\T
to the the vertical place \fIN\fR.
For \fIall\fR other requests and functions,
\fB~\|\fIN\fR
becomes the distance from
the current horizontal place on the \fIinput\fR line to the horizontal place \fIN\fR.
\A'a_usesp'For example,
.x1
\&\fB.sp  ~\|3.2c\fR
.x2
will space \fIin the required direction\fR to 3.2\|centimeters from the top of the page.
.sc
.tr &&
\A'c_expr'Numerical expressions.
Wherever numerical input is expected an expression involving parentheses,
the arithmetic operators \fB\(pl\fR, \fB\(mi\fR, \fB/\fR, \fB\(**\fR, \fB%\fR (mod),
the logical operators
\fB<\fR,
\fB>\fR,
\fB<=\fR,
\fB>=\fR,
\fB=\fR (or \fB==\fR),
\fB<>\fR (not equal),
\fB&\fR\ (and),
\fB:\fR\ (or),
and the functions
\fIa\fB<?\fIb\fR (minimum of \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR)
and
\fIa\fB>?\fIb\fR (maximum of \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR)
may be used.
Except where controlled by parentheses, evaluation of expressions is left-to-right;
there is no operator precedence.
In the case of certain requests, an initial \fB\(pl\fR or \fB\(mi\fR is stripped
and interpreted as an increment or decrement indicator respectively.
In the presence of default scaling, the desired scale indicator must be
attached to \fIevery\fR number in an expression
for which the desired and default scaling differ.
For example,
if the number register \fBx\fR contains 2
and the current point size is 10,
then
.br
.tr &.
.x1

\&.ll  (4.25i\(pl\enxP\(pl3)/2u

will set the line length to 1/2 the sum of 4.25 inches \(pl 2 picas \(pl 30 points.
.sc
Notation.
Numerical parameters are indicated in this manual in two ways.
\(+-\fIN\fR means that the argument may take the forms \fIN\fR, \(pl\fIN\fR, or \(mi\fIN\fR and
that the corresponding effect is to set the affected parameter
to \fIN\fR, to increment it by \fIN\fR, or to decrement it by \fIN\fR respectively.
Plain \fIN\fR means that an initial algebraic sign is \fInot\fR
an increment indicator,
but merely the sign of \fIN\fR.
Generally, unreasonable numerical input is either ignored
or truncated to a reasonable value.
For example,
most requests expect to set parameters to non-negative
values;
exceptions are
\fB\T'sp'sp\T\fR,
\fB\T'wh'wh\T\fR,
\fB\T'ch'ch\T\fR,
\fB\T'nr'nr\T\fR,

\A'c_char'Character set.
The basic \*(TR character set
is defined by a description file
specific to each output device \T's_device'(\(sc26).\T
There are normally several regular fonts
and one or more special fonts.
The basic character set is shown in the attached
\T'Table I'Table|I\T.
All \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters are included,
with some on the Special Font.
With three exceptions, the \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters are input as themselves,
and non-\s-1ASCII\s+1 characters are input
in the form \A'e_('\fB\e(\fIxx\fR where
\fIxx\fR is a two-character name given in the attached
\T'Table II'Table|II\T.
The three \s-1ASCII\s+1 exceptions are mapped as follows:
.TS

\A'e_acute'\'	acute accent	'	close quote
\A'e_grave'\`	grave accent	`	open quote
\A'e_-'\(mi	minus	\(en	hyphen
.TE
.tr ~~
The characters
\fB\'\fR,
\fB\`\fR,
and
\fB\-\fR
may be input
by \fB\e\'\fR, \fB\e\`\fR, and \fB\e\-\fR respectively or by their names
\T'Table II'(Table II)\T.
In traditional \*[TR,],
the \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters \fB@\fR, \fB#\fR, \fB"\fR, \fB\(aa\fR, \fB\(ga\fR, \fB<\fR, \fB>\fR, \fB\e\fR, \fB{\fR, \fB}\fR, \fB~\fR, \fB^\fR, and \fB\(ul\fR existed
only on the Special Font and were printed as a 1-em space if that Font
was not mounted.
With the \fBpslow\fR device,
these characters print in the \fITimes\fR font by default
regardless of the current font
(but see the \T'fps'\fBfps\fR\T request below).
With other devices,
these characters are taken from the current font.
.pg
With Type\ 1, OpenType, and TrueType fonts,
\*(TR allows to access all named \*(PS
characters of the current font and
of those in the \T'fallback'\fBfallback\fR\T sequence
in the forms \A'e_['\fB\e[\fIname\fB]\fR or \A'e_C'\fB\eC\fI\'name\'\fR.
.pg
\*(TR internally converts non-\s-1ASCII\s+1 characters
of the current \s-1LC_CTYPE\s+1 locale
to named \*(PS characters
once they are read in regular (not \T'copy mode'\fIcopy\fR\T) mode.
If the current font is an OpenType or a TrueType font and contains
a custom Unicode mapping table, the input character is looked up in that
table first.
Otherwise, a default table is used. A character that is not
present in the current font is searched
using the \T'fallback'\fBfallback\fR\T sequence
first, then in the special fonts.
If the character cannot be found, it is discarded.
Characters for which no name is known are replaced by spaces.
.pg
The \A'e_N'\fB\eN\fI\'n\'\fR escape sequence
has historically been available to refer
to character \fIn\fR of the current font.
It is still accepted,
but its use is discouraged with 
Type\ 1, OpenType, and TrueType fonts
since the arrangement of character in font tables
is performed at run-time
and may change with future versions of \*[TR.]
.pg
.tr ~|
\*(NR has an analogous, but different, mechanism for defining legal characters
and how to print them.
By default all characters are valid.
There are such
additional characters as may be available on
the output device,
such characters as may be able to be constructed
by overstriking or other combination,
and those that can reasonably be mapped
into other printable characters.
The exact behavior is determined by a driving
table prepared for each device.
The characters
\fB\'\fR,
\fB\`\fR,
and
\fB\(ul\fR
print
as themselves.
.pg
Both \*(NR and \*(TR allow references to specific
Unicode characters with the \A'e_U'\fB\eU\fI\'X\'\fR escape sequence;
it causes the character at position U+\fIX\fR to be printed
(\fIX\fR is a hexadecimal number).
For \*[TR,] it is required that this character
is available in one of the fonts mounted at this point.
As an example, \eU\'20AC\' prints the Euro character \U'20AC'.
.sc
\A'c_fonts'Fonts.
\*(TR
begins execution by reading information for a set of defaults fonts,
said to be
.I mounted;
conventionally, the first four are
Times Roman (\&\fBR\fR),
Times Italic
(\&\fBI\fR),
Times Bold
(\&\fBB\fR),
and
Times Bold Italic
(\&\fBBI\fR),
and the last is a Special font (\fBS\fR)
containing miscellaneous characters.
The set of fonts and positions is determined by the device description file,
described in \T's_device'\(sc26\T.
.pg
The \fIcurrent\fR font, initially Roman, may be changed
(among the mounted fonts)
by use of the \T'ft'\fBft\fR\T request,
or by imbedding at any desired point
either \A'e_f'\fB\ef\fIx\fR, \fB\ef(\fIxx\fR, \fB\ef[\fIxxx\fB]\fR, or \fB\ef\fIN\fR
where
\fIx\fR, \fIxx\fR, and \fIxxx\fR are the name of a mounted font
and \fIN\fR is a numerical font position.
.pg
It is \fInot\fR necessary to change to the Special font;
characters on that font are automatically handled
as if they were physically part of the current font.
The Special font may actually be several fonts;
the name \fBS\fP
is reserved and is generally used for one of these.
The \T'fallback'\fBfallback\fR\T request sets a font-specific sequence
of additional fonts that are searched for missing characters.
.pg
\*(TR can be informed that any particular font is mounted
by use of the \T'fp'\fBfp\fR\T request.
The list of known fonts is installation dependent.
In the subsequent discussion of font-related requests,
\fIF\fR represents either a one/two-character
font name or the numerical font position.
The current font is available (as numerical position)
in the read-only number register \A'n_.f'\fB.f\fR;
the \A'n_.fp'\fB.fp\fR register holds the next unused position.
.pg
A request for a named but not-mounted font is honored
if the font description information exists.
In this way, there is no limit on the number of fonts that may be printed
in any part of a document.
Mounted fonts may be handled more efficiently,
and they may be referred to by their mount positions,
but there is no other difference.
Mention of an unmounted font loads it temporarily at font position
zero, which serves as a one-font cache.
.pg
The function \A'e_S'\fB\eS\fI'\(+-N'\fR
causes the current font to be slanted by \fI\(+-N\fR degrees.
Not all devices support slanting.
.pg
\*(NR understands font control
and normally underlines Italic characters \T'c_nrofful'(see \(sc10.5).\T
.sc
Character size.
Character point sizes available depend on the specific output device;
a typical (historical) set of values is
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, and 36.
This is a range of 1/12 inch to 1/2 inch.
Modern output devices such as the default \fBdevps\fR
usually allow the point size to be set to arbitrary values,
including fractional points.
The \T'ps'\fBps\fR\T request is used to change or restore the point size.
Alternatively the point size may be changed between any two characters
by imbedding a \A'e_s'\fB\es\fIN\fR
at the desired point
to set the size to \fIN\fR,
or a \fB\es\fI\(+-N\fR (1\(<=\fIN\fR\(<=8)
to increment/decrement the size by \fIN\fR;
\fB\es0\fR restores the \fIprevious\fR size.
On historical output devices,
requested point size values that are between two valid
sizes yielded the larger of the two.
.pg
Note that through an accident of history, a construction like
.B \es39
is parsed as size 39, and thus converted to size 36 (given the sizes above),
while
.B \es40
is parsed as size 4 followed by 
\fB0\fR.
The forms
\fB\es(\fInn\fR, \fB\es\(+-(\fInn\fR,
\fB\es\'\fI\(+-nn\fB\'\fR, \fB\es\fI\(+-\fB\'\fInn\fB\'\fR,
\fB\es[\fI\(+-nn\fB]\fR, and \fB\es\fI\(+-\fB[\fInn\fB]\fR
permit specification of sizes that would otherwise be ambiguous.
.pg
The current size is available in the \A'n_.s'\fB.s\fR register.
Note that this may be a decimal fraction
if the current point size is not an integer.
Since standard number registers cannot hold decimal
fractions, point sizes should be saved and restored as follows:
\fB&nr \fIos\fB \en(.sp\fR ... \fB&ps \en(\fIos\fBu\fR.
\*(NR ignores type size control.
.pg
The function \A'e_H'\fB\eH\fI\'\(+-N'\fR
sets \H'+2'the height of the current font\H'0' to
\fIN\fP, or increments it by +\fIN\fR, or decrements it by \-\fIN\fP;
if \fIN\fR=0, the height is restored to the current point size.
In each case, the width is unchanged.
Not all devices support independent height and width for characters.
.h1
.bta lc_ctype
\fB&lc_ctype\fI|name\fR	ignored	\(en	Set the \s-1LC_CTYPE\s+1 locale
to \fIname\fR.
The default is the value
of the \s-1LC_CTYPE\s+1 environment variable.
This request is
useful to specify an input character set regardless of environment
influences.
The current value is available in the \A'n_.lc_ctype'\fB&lc_ctype\fR
number register.
.bta ps
\fB&ps\fI|\(+-N\fR	10\|point	previous	E,\fBp\fR	Point size
set to \(+-\fIN\fR.
Alternatively imbed \fB\es\fIN\fR, \fB\es\fI\(+-N\fR,
or \fB\es\'\fIN\fB\'\fR.
Any positive size value may be requested on modern devices.
If invalid, the next larger valid size will result on traditional devices,
with a maximum of 36.
A paired sequence
\(pl\fIN\fR,\|\(mi\fIN\fR
will work because the previous requested value is also remembered.
Ignored in \*[NR.]
.bta fzoom
\fB&fzoom\fI|F|Z\fR	1	ignored	P,T	Zoom font \fIF\fR by factor \fIZ\fR,
which is a positive floating point number.
This request is useful for adjusting fonts with different
visual sizes but identical nominal points; the zoom is thus not
applied to characters from another font that have been found by
the \T'fallback'\fBfallback\fR\T sequence or by the special font mechanism.
The current value of the current font is available
in the \A'n_.fzoom'\fB&fzoom\fR number register.
.bta ss
\fB&ss\fI|N\fR|[\fIM\fR]	12/36\|m	ignored	E,T	Space-character size
is set to \fIN\fR/36\|ems.
This size is the minimum word spacing in adjusted text.
The optional second argument
sets the space that is added between sentences
to \fIM\fR/36\|ems.
Ignored in \*[NR.]
The number registers \A'n_.ss'\fB&ss\fR and \A'n_.sss'\fB&sss\fR
contain the current values of \fIN\fR and \fIM\fR, respectively.
.bta cs
\fB&cs\|\fIF\|N\|M\fR	off	\(en	P	Constant character space
(width) mode is
set on for font \fIF\fR (if mounted); the width of every character will be
taken to be \fIN\fR/36 ems.
If \fIM\fR is absent,
the em is that of the character's point size;
if \fIM\fR is given,
the em is \fIM\fR-points.
All affected characters
are centered in this space, including those with an actual width
larger than this space.
Special Font characters occurring while the current font
is \fIF\fR are also so treated.
If \fIN\fR is absent, the mode is turned off.
The mode must be still or again in effect when the characters are physically printed.
Ignored in \*[NR.]
.bta bd
\fB&bd\fI|F|N\fR	off	\(en	P	The characters in font \fIF\fR will be artificially
emboldened by printing each one twice, separated by \fIN\fR\^\(mi1 basic units.
A reasonable value for \fIN\fR is 3 when the character size is in the vicinity
of 10 points.
If \fIN\fR is missing the embolden mode is turned off.
The emboldening value \fIN\fP is in the \A'n_.b'\fB.b\fR register.
.xx
.bd R 3
This paragraph is printed with \fI.bd R 3\fR.

The mode must be still or again in effect when the characters are physically printed.
.bta ft
\fB&ft|\fIF\fR	Roman	previous	E	Font changed to
\fIF\fR.
Alternatively, imbed \fB\ef\fIF\fR.
The font name \fBP\fR is reserved to mean the previous font,
and the name \fBS\fR for the special font.
.bta fp
\fB&fp|\fIN|F|\fR[\fIfile|\fR[\fIsupply\fR]]	ignored	\(en	Font position.
This is a statement
that a font named \fIF\fR is mounted on position \fIN\fR.
With two arguments,
it is a fatal error if \fIF\fR is not known
as a legacy \*(TR font file \T'c_fontdescr'(\(sc26.2).\T
.xx
With three or more arguments,
font metrics are read from the given \fIfile\fR,
which must be in Type\ 1, OpenType,
or TrueType format.
If the \fB\s-1TROFFONTS\s+1\fR environment variable is set,
each of the colon-separated directories in it is tested for the files
\fIfile.afm\fR, \fIfile.otf\fR, \fIfile.ttf\fR,
or, if the \fIfile\fR argument
has an \fB.afm\fR, \fB.otf\fR, or \fB.ttf\fR extension itself,
for \fIfile\fR.
Otherwise, the font is loaded from the file
\fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps/\fIfile\fB.afm\fR.
.xx
The \fIN\fR argument specifies a register on which
the font is to be mounted (1\(<=\fIN\fR\(<=255).
If it is zero, the font is mounted on the next
free position (not on position zero).
At most 255 fonts may be mounted simultaneously;
it is possible to use more than 255 fonts in a document
by reusing font registers.
.xx
The font is then available with \fB&ft F\fR, \fB\efF\fR, etc.
\fBF\fR may be freely chosen,
and may consist of more than two characters.
.xx
\fIF\fR may be the name of a previously mounted font, such
as \fBR\fR. In this case, the same \fIN\fR register must be reused. For best
compatibility with conventional \*(TR usage, it is recommended
that the base fonts of a document are mounted as ``1\ R'', ``2\ I'',
``3\ B'', ``4\ BI''.
The initial fonts on positions 9 (\fBS1\fR) and 10 (\fBS\fR) should not be
changed, as they contain special metrics for drawing commands.
.xx
If the optional \fIsupply\fR argument is present, glyph data
is included in the generated \*(PS file. If \fIsupply\fR
is one of \fBotf\fR, \fBpfb\fR, \fBpfa\fR, \fBttf\fR, or \fBt42\fR, the file
\fIsupply.pfb\fR (or likewise) is searched in the directories
in \fB\s-1TROFFONTS\s+1\fR first as described
for the \s-1AFM\s+1 file above, and if it is not found there, in
\fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/devps/\fIsupply\fB.pfb\fR (or
likewise). \fIsupply\fR may also be the basename of a file like
\fIfile\fR above.
.xx
The character \fB%\fR can be used to escape arbitrary bytes in
font file names. In particular, this is necessary to use font
files whose names contain spaces, bytes outside the ASCII range,
or a \fB%\fR itself. \fB%\fIxx\fR represents the byte with the hexadecimal
code \fIxx\fR, e.g., \fB%20\fR is a space character. In the path names
in TROFFONTS, only the \fB%\fR and \fB:\fR characters have to be masked
using this mechanism.
.bta fps
\fB&fps\fI|map|...\fR		ignored	T	\
Mount a font with a special character map.
By default, special characters like \fB\e(\(**a\fR
are not assigned when a font is mounted
even if a matching named \*(PS character (like \fB\e[alpha]\fR)
would have been available. The following special character maps
exist:
.xx
\fBmath\fR	mathematical characters like \(<= \(cu \(-> \(if
.br
\fBgreek\fR	greek characters like \(*a \(*b \(*g \(*A \(*B \(*G
.br
\fBpunct\fR	the characters \e(or \- \e\` \e\' " # < > @ \e ^ ~
.br
\fBlarge\fR	parts of large characters like \(rc \(rk \(lb \(lk
.xx
The \fBpunct\fR map is used by default
for the \fBps\fR and \fBpsmed\fR devices.
.xx
The remaining arguments are handled as described for \T'fp'\fBfp\fR.\T
.bta feature
\fB&feature\fI|F|\(+-name|...\fR	ignored	P,T	\
Enable (+) or disable (\-) the OpenType feature \fIname\fR in font \fIF\fR.
Only OpenType features that result in context-insensitive
single-character substitutions are supported. Typical features
are \fBonum\fR to enable old-style numerals, or \fBsmcp\fR to enable
small capitals.
.bta fallback
\fB&fallback\fI|F|A|B|...\fR	ignored	P,T	\
Select the fallback sequence for font \fIF\fR.
If the current font is \fIF\fR and a character is not found,
font \fIA\fR is searched first, then font \fIB\fR, etc.
If the character still has not been found,
it is searched for in the Special Font,
then in the fonts mounted at positions 0, 1, and so forth.
.bta hidechar
\fB&hidechar\fI|F|c|d|...\fR	ignored	P,T	Hide the characters \fIc\fR, \fId\fR, etc. from font F.
If the characters appear in input afterwards,
they are searched in other fonts using the fallback sequence.
This is useful e.g. for combining characters from a regular
and a Type\ 1 expert font.
.bta fspacewidth
\fB&fspacewidth\fI|F|\fR[\fIN\fR]	ignored	T	Set the width
of the space character in font \fIF\fR to \fIN\fR,
which is given in units of 1/72000 of an inch multiplied by the
current point size or 1/1000 of an em (as in \s-1AFM\s+1 kerning pair
definitions). If only one argument is present, the space width
is set to the width of the \fBspace\fR character as obtained from the
font metrics file. If the space width for a font is not set
explicitly using this request, it defaults to 1/3 em for
variable-width fonts, or to the width of the \fBspace\fR character
for monospaced fonts.
.xx
When the width of spaces in output is actually computed,
the space size as set by \T'ss'\fBss\fR\T is also taken into account.
The space width as defined above is used directly with
\fB&ss 12\fR, which is the default. Otherwise, it is multiplied
by the \fBss\fR setting divided by 12.
.mha s_page
Page control
.pg
Top and bottom margins are \fInot\fR automatically provided;
it is conventional to define two \fImacros\fR and to set \fItraps\fR
for them at vertical positions 0 (top) and \fI\(miN\fR (\fIN\fR from the bottom).
See \T's_mac'\(sc7\T and \T'T2'Tutorial Examples \(scT2.\T
A pseudo-page transition onto the \fIfirst\fR page occurs
either when the first \fIbreak\fR occurs or
when the first \fInon-diverted\fR text processing occurs.
Arrangements
for a trap to occur at the top of the first page
must be completed before this transition.
In the following, references to the \T'c_diversion'\fIcurrent diversion\fR (\(sc7.4)\T
mean that the mechanism being described works during both
ordinary and diverted output (the former considered as the top diversion level).
.pg
The physical limitations on \*(TR and \*(NR output
are device dependent.
.h1
.bta pl
\fB&pl\fI|\(+-N\fR	11\|in	11\|in	\fBv\fR	Page length set to \fI\(+-N\fR.
The current page length is available in the \A'n_.p'\fB.p\fR register.
.bta papersize
\fB&papersize\fI|media\fR	ignored	T,\fBu\fR	Set the paper size.
\fImedia\fR can be one of
\fBexecutive\fR,
\fBletter\fR,
\fBlegal\fR,
\fBledger\fR,
\fBtabloid\fR,
\fBa\fIN\fR,
\fBb\fIN\fR,
\fBc\fIN\fR,
or two numbers giving the width and height directly.
The page length is set from these
parameters, the page offset and line length are adjusted as needed,
and the post-processor is informed about the page metrics for its
internal calculations.
The last action is the real reason why this
request exists; without it, \*(PS printers may displace the
pages of the document. The default are \fBletter\fR measurements. This
request should be used early in a document; if it is given multiple
times, the last one will setup the device.
.bta mediasize
\fB&mediasize\fI|media\fR	ignored	T,\fBu\fR	Set the device media size.
\fImedia\fR can be one of
\fBexecutive\fR,
\fBletter\fR,
\fBlegal\fR,
\fBledger\fR,
\fBtabloid\fR,
\fBa\fIN\fR,
\fBb\fIN\fR,
\fBc\fIN\fR,
or two numbers giving the width and height directly.
This request performs the same actions as
\T'papersize'\fBpapersize\fR\T and generates
a device setup command in addition (the \*(PS Level 2 operator
\fBsetpagedevice\fR as well as the DSC comment
\fB%%DocumentMedia:\fR with \fIdpost\fR).
The effect of this command can be the selection of a
matching paper tray on a printer; on the other hand, the document
may not print at all if no such tray is available.
In general, it is recommended to use printer-specific
options from a \s-1PPD\s+1 file
when the file is submitted to the print spooling system instead
of this request.
However, when generating \*(PS as
intermediate format with the intent of \*[PDF] creation, use of this
request is recommended.
.bta cropat
\fB&cropat\fI|L|T|W|H\fR	ignored	T,\fBp\fR	Set the ``CropBox'' page parameter for \*[PDF] generation.
The four arguments give the offset from the left (\fIL\fR)
and top (\fIT\fR) margins of the document
(as set by \T'mediasize'\fBmediasize\fR\T),
and width (\fIW\fR) and height (\fIH\fR) of the box.
The default units are points.
The CropBox restricts the
area of the page that is shown by a \*[PDF] viewer program. It is
useful to hide cut marks and other printing instructions when
the same \*[PDF] document is intended to be displayed on screen.
.bta trimat
\fB&trimat\fI|L|T|W|H\fR	ignored	T,\fBp\fR	Set the ``TrimBox'' page parameter for \*[PDF] generation
and enables printing of marks when combined with \fIdpost\ \-M\fR.
The four arguments give the offset from the left (\fIL\fR)
and top (\fIT\fR) margins of the document
(as set by \T'mediasize'\fBmediasize\fR\T),
and width (\fIW\fR) and height (\fIH\fR) of the box.
The default units are points.
The TrimBox specifies how
the page is to be cut after it has been printed; it is sort of
an electronic equivalent for cut marks (which should continue to
be printed in addition).
.bta bleedat
\fB&bleedat\fI|L|T|W|H\fR	ignored	T,\fBp\fR	Set the ``BleedBox'' page parameter for \*[PDF] generation.
The four arguments give the offset from the left (\fIL\fR)
and top (\fIT\fR) margins of the document
(as set by \T'mediasize'\fBmediasize\fR\T),
and width (\fIW\fR) and height (\fIH\fR) of the box.
The default units are points.
The BleedBox should be defined
as a a frame around the objects of the actual document including
any bleed areas (i.e. content that should extend to the end of the
trimmed final page but is extended a bit such to work around
possible cutting inaccuracies). Cut marks, color bars, and other
information for the printing office should be positioned outside
the BleedBox.
.bta bp
\fB&bp\fI|\(+-N\fR	\fIN\(eq\fR1	\(en	B,\fBv\fR	Begin page.
The current page is ejected and a new page is begun.
If \fI\(+-N\fR is given, the new page number will be \fI\(+-N\fR.
Also see request \T'ns'\fBns\fR\T.
.bta pn
\fB&pn\fI|\(+-N\fR	\fIN\fR\(eq1	ignored	\(en	Page number.
The next page (when it occurs) will have the page number \fI\(+-N\fR.
A \fBpn\fR must occur before the initial pseudo-page transition

The current page number is in the \A'n_%'\fB%\fR register.
.bta po
\fB&po\fI|\(+-N\fR	0;|1\|in	previous	\fBv\fR	Page offset.
The current \fIleft margin\fR is set to \fI\(+-N\fR.
The \*(TR initial value provides about 1|inch of paper margin

The current page offset is available in the \A'n_.o'\fB.o\fR register.
.bta ne
\fB&ne\fI|N\fR	\(en	\fIN\(eq\fR1\|\fIV\fR	D,\fBv\fR	Need \fIN\fR vertical space.
If the distance, \fID\fR, to the next trap position
\T'c_trap'(see \(sc7.5)\T is less than \fIN\fR,
a forward vertical space of size \fID\fR occurs,
which will spring the trap.
If there are no remaining
traps on the page,
\fID\fR is the distance to the bottom of the page.
If \fID\|<\|V\fR, another line could still be output
and spring the trap.
In a \T'c_diversion'diversion\T,
\fID\fR is the distance to the \fIdiversion trap\fR, if any,
or is very large.
.bta mk
\fB&mk\fI|R\fR	none	internal	D	Mark the \fIcurrent\fR vertical place

See \fBrt\fR request.
.bta rt
\fB&rt\fI|\(+-N\fR	none	internal	D,\fBv\fR	Return \fIupward only\fR to a marked vertical place

If \fI\(+-N\fR (w.r.t. current place) is given,
the place is \fI\(+-N\fR from the top of the page or \T'c_diversion'diversion\T
or, if \fIN\fR is absent, to a
place marked by a previous \fBmk\fR.
Note that the \T'sp'\fBsp\fR request (\(sc5.3)\T may be used
in all cases instead of \fBrt\fR
by spacing to the absolute place stored in a explicit register;
e.|g. using the sequence \fB.mk|\fIR\fR ... \fB.sp|~\|\en\fIR\fBu\fR;
this also works when the motion is downwards.
.mha s_fill
Text Filling, Adjusting, and Centering
.sc
Filling and adjusting.
Normally,
words are collected from input text lines
and assembled into a output text line
until some word does not fit.
An attempt is then made
the hyphenate the word in effort to assemble a part
of it into the output line.
The spaces between the words on the output line
are then increased to spread out the line
to the current \fIline length\fR
minus any current \fIindent\fR.
A \fIword\fR is any string of characters delimited by
the \fIspace\fR character or the beginning/end of the input line.
Any adjacent pair of words that must be kept together
(neither split across output lines nor spread apart
in the adjustment process)
can be tied together by separating them with the
\fIunpaddable space\fR character
\T'e_ '"\fB\e\ \ \fR" (backslash-space).\T
The adjusted word spacings are uniform in \*(TR
and the minimum interword spacing can be controlled
with the \T'ss'\fBss\fR request\T \T's_font'(\(sc2).\T
In \*[NR,] word spacings are normally nonuniform because of
quantization to character-size spaces;
however,
the command line option \fB\-e\fR causes uniform
spacing with full output device resolution.
Filling, adjustment, and hyphenation \T's_hyphen'(\(sc13)\T can all be
prevented or controlled.
The \fItext length\fR on the last line output is available
in the \A'n_.n'\fB.n\fR register,
and text base-line position on the page for this line is
in the \A'n_nl'\fBnl\fR register.
The text base-line high-water mark (lowest place) on the current page is in
the \A'n_.h'\fB.h\fR register.
The current horizontal output position
is in the \A'n_.k'\fB.k\fR register.
.pg
\*(TR can optionally decrease word spacings,
change the letter spacing,
and reshape letters
when adjusting lines to fit on both margins.
The interword spacing controlled with the \T'ss'\fBss\fR request\T
is then understood as the optimum setting.
Words are collected from input until the first word
that would require to condense spacing or letter shapings is encountered.
Between the end of the previous word and the end of this word,
hyphenation points are additionally examined
until the two possibilities to end the line
surrounding the optimum are found.
The point closest to the optimum is then chosen.
If the word spacing so determined would fall below
the minimum allowed, letter spacings and shapings are condensed.
If it would exceed the threshold for expanded letter spacing and letter shaping,
it is attempted to compensate until the threshold is reached,
up to the maximum allowed letter spacing
and letter shaping.
Remaining space is distributed among the word spacings.
Distribution among letter spacings and shaping is equal
until one of the respective limits is reached.
Lines that terminate with a \fIbreak\fR
are normally set using the optimum word and line spacings
unless the last word collected is the first word
that falls below the optimum spacing,
which may result in condensed spacing and shaping.
.pg
.tr &&
An input text line ending with \fB.\fR\^, \fB?\fR, \fB!\fR, or \fB:\fR,
optionally followed by any number of \fB"\fR, \fB\'\fR,
\fB)\fR, \fB]\fR, \fB*\fR, or \fB\(dg\fR,
is taken
to be the end of a \fIsentence\fR, and an additional space character is
automatically provided during filling.
To prevent this at individual locations,
add \A'e_&'\fB\e&\fR to the end of the input line;
the \T'ss'\fBss\fR request\T \T's_font'(\(sc2)\T
changes the size of this space character and can also disable it globally.
Both the sentence-ending and the transparent characters are configurable.
Multiple inter-word space characters found in the input are retained,
except for trailing spaces;
initial spaces also cause a \fIbreak\fR.
.pg
When filling is in effect, a \A'e_p'\fB\ep\fR may be imbedded or attached to a word to
cause a \fIbreak\fR at the \fIend\fR of the word and have the resulting output
line \fIspread out\fR to fill the current line length.
.pg
A text input line that happens to begin
with a control character can
be made to not look like a control line
by prefacing it with
the non-printing, zero-width filler character \fB\e&\fR.
Still another way is to specify output translation of some
convenient character into the control character
using \T'tr'\fBtr\fR\T \T'c_trans'(\(sc10.5).\T
.sc
Interrupted text.
The copying of a input line in \fInofill\f (non-fill) mode can be \fIinterrupted\fR
by terminating
the partial line with a \A'e_c'\fB\ec\fR.
The \fInext\fR encountered input text line will be considered to be a continuation
of the same line of input text.
Similarly,
a word within \fIfilled\fR text may be interrupted by terminating the
word (and line) with \fB\ec\fR;
the next encountered text will be taken as a continuation of the
interrupted word.
If the intervening control lines cause a break,
any partial line will be forced out along with any partial word.
.sc
Kerning.
\*(TR reads kerning tables from Type\ 1,
OpenType, and TrueType font files.
These tables contain small horizontal spacing adjustments
for pairs of individual characters,
e.g., the pair ``Vo'' would print as ``V\&o''
without kerning applied.
Placing \fB\e&\fR between two characters
disables kerning at that location;
the \T'kern'\fBkern\fR\T request can disable it globally.
The \T'kernpair'\fBkernpair\fR\T request adds a kerning pair;
in contrast to predefined pairs,
it allows the characters to originate from different fonts.
.pg
.kernafter R \[guillemotleft] 66
.kernbefore R \[guillemotright] 66
It is sometimes useful to add or substact a constant amount of spacing
whenever a specific character appears;
for example, \[guillemotleft]french\[guillemotright]
quotation marks usually require some additional distance
to the words contained in them.
The \T'kernafter'\fBkernafter\fR\T and
\T'kernbefore'\fBkernbefore\fR\T requests allow
to define such adjustments.
Again, a \fB\e&\fR disables them at individual points;
they are generally not applied if the other character is a space.
.tr &.
.sc
Hanging characters.
Characters can hang beyond the left or right margins of adjusted text;
the \T'lhang'\fBlhang\fR\T and
\T'rhang'\fBrhang\fR\T requests specify this.
Left margin adjustments are evaluated before the letters that fit on the
current line are computed, and can thus principally be of any length.
In contrast, right margin adjustments are evaluated after this computation
is finished, and the adjustment is simply added to the word space of the
output line.
Thus a positive right adjustment that is large in relation
to the line length will cause visible holes, and a negative adjustment
will ultimately cause the words on the line to be printed over each
other.
This is not a problem for the typical application of hanging
punctuation for visual alignment, though;
if e.g. a line with eight word
spaces is shifted by .08 em,
each word space is enlarged by only .01 em.

white space of width \fIN\fR is added to each character.
If the point size is above or equal to \fIT\fR,
white space of width \fIM\fR is added.
If the point size is between \fIS\fR and \fIT\fR,
the amount of white space added is computed

(\fIs\^M\fR\-\fIs\^N\fR+\fIT\^N\fR\-\fIS\^M\fR)\|/\|(\fIT\fR\-\fIS\fR).
The default unit for all numeric arguments is points.
Negative numbers are accepted and

Vertical Spacing
.sc
Base-line spacing.
The vertical spacing \fI(V)\fR between the base-lines of successive
output lines can be set
using the \T'vs'\fBvs\fR\T request.
\fIV\fR should be large enough to accommodate the character sizes
on the affected output lines.
For the common type sizes (9-12 points),
usual typesetting practice is to set \fIV\fR to 2\ points greater than the
point size;
\*(TR default is 10-point type on a 12-point spacing
(as in this document).
The current \fIV\fR is available in the \A'n_.v'\fB.v\fR register.
Multiple-\fIV\|\fR line separation (e.\|g. double spacing) may be requested
with \T'ls'\fBls\fR,\T
but it is better to use a large \T'vs'\fBvs\fR\T instead;
certain preprocessors assume single spacing.
The current line spacing is available in the \A'n_.L'\fB.L\fR register.
.sc
Extra line-space.
If a word contains a vertically tall construct requiring
the output line containing it to have extra vertical space
before and/or after it,
the \fIextra-line-space\fR function \A'e_x'\fB\ex\fI\'N\'\fR
can be imbedded in or attached to that word.
If \fIN\fR is negative,
the output line containing the word will
be preceded by \fIN\fR extra vertical space;
if \fIN\fR is positive,
the output line containing the word
will be followed by \fIN\fR extra vertical space.
If successive requests for extra space apply to the same line,
the maximum values are used.
The most recently utilized post-line extra line-space is available
in the \A'n_.a'\fB.a\fR register.
.pg
In \fB\ex\fI\'...\'\fR and other functions having a pair of delimiters around
their parameter (here \fB\'\fR\|),
the delimiter choice is arbitrary,
except that it can not look like the continuation
of a \T'c_expr'number expression\T for \fIN\fR.
.sc
Blocks of vertical space.
A block of vertical space is ordinarily requested using \T'sp'\fBsp\fR,\T
which honors the \fIno-space\fR mode and which does
not space \fIpast\fR a trap.
A contiguous block of vertical space may be reserved using \T'sv'\fBsv\fR.\T
.sc
Ascenders and descenders.
Type\ 1, OpenType, and TrueType metrics
supply information about the typical extents
of characters above the base-line (ascender) and below it (descender).
Usually, these correspond to the top of the lowercase ``d''
and the bottom of the lowercase ``p'', respectively.
The \A'n_.ascender'\fB&ascender\fR
and \A'n_.descender'\fB&descender\fR number registers
contain these values in units
with correct scaling for the current point size applied.
If no values are available,
these registers are set to zero.

Macros, Strings, Diversion, and Position Traps
.sc
Macros and strings.
A \fImacro\fR is a named set of arbitrary \fIlines\fR that may be invoked by name or
with a \fItrap\fR.
A \fIstring\fR is a named string of \fIcharacters\fR,
\fInot\fR including a newline character,
that may be interpolated by name at any point.
Request, macro, and string names share the \fIsame\fR name list.
Macro and string names
may consist of an arbitrary number of \s-1ASCII\s+1 characters
\T'c_char'(\(sc1.1)\T
and may usurp previously defined
request, macro, or string names;
this implies that build-in operators may be (irrevocably) redefined.
Any of these entities may be renamed with \T'rn'\fBrn\fR\T
or removed with \T'rm'\fBrm\fR.\T
Macros are created by \T'de'\fBde\fR\T and \T'di'\fBdi\fR,\T
and appended to by \T'am'\fBam\fR\T and \T'da'\fBda\fR;\T
\T'di'\fBdi\fR\T and \T'da'\fBda\fR\T cause normal output
to be stored in a macro.
Strings are created by \T'ds'\fBds\fR\T and appended to by \T'as'\fBas\fR.\T
A macro is invoked in the same way as a request;
a control line beginning \fB.\fIxx\fR will interpolate the contents of macro \fIxx\fR.
The remainder of the line may contain arbitrarily many \fIarguments\fR.
The strings \fIx\fR, \fIxx\fR, and \fIxxx\fR
are interpolated at any desired point with
\A'e_*'\fB\e\(**\fIx\fR, \fB\e\(**(\fIxx\fR,
and \fB\e\(**[\fIxxx\fB]\fR respectively;
the form \fB\e\(**[\fIxxx\ arg\ \fR...\fB]\fR
allows to specify arguments to a string.
String references and macro invocations may be nested.
.sc
\A'copy mode'Copy mode input interpretation.
During the definition and extension
of strings and macros (not by \T'c_diversion'diversion\T)
the input is read in \fIcopy mode\fR.
The input is copied without interpretation
\fIexcept\fR that:
.x1
.nr nosave 0
.ds + \v'-.1m'\s-4\(bu\s+4\v'+.1m'
\*+ The contents of number registers indicated by \T'e_'\fB\en\fR\T are interpolated.

\*+ Arguments indicated by \T'e_$'\fB\e$\fR\T are interpolated.
\*+ Environment variables indicated by \T'e_V'\fB\eV\fR\T are interpolated.
\*+ Device control functions indicated by \T'e_X'\fB\eX\fR\T are executed.
\*+ Concealed newlines indicated by \T'e_newline'\fB\e\fR\T(newline) are eliminated.
\*+ Comments indicated by \T'e_"'\fB\e"\fR\T or \T'e_#'\fB\e#\fR\T are eliminated.
\*+ \T'e_t'\fB\et\fR\T and \T'e_a'\fB\ea\fR\T are interpreted as \s-1ASCII\s+1 horizontal tab and \s-1SOH\s+1 respectively \T's_tabs'(\(sc9).\T
\*+ \T'e_e'\fB\e\e\fR\T is interpreted as \fB\e\fR.
\*+ \T'e_.'\fB\e.\fR\T is interpreted as "\fB.\fR".
.x2
These interpretations can be suppressed by
prepending
a \fB\e\fR.
For example, since \fB\e\e\fR maps into a \fB\e\fR,
\fB\e\en\fR will copy as \T'e_n'\fB\en\fR\T which
will be interpreted as a number register indicator when the
macro or string is reread.
.sc
Arguments.
When a macro is invoked by name, the remainder of the line is
taken to contain arguments.
The argument separator is the space character, and arguments
may be surrounded by double-quotes to permit imbedded space characters.
Pairs of double-quotes may be imbedded in double-quoted arguments to
represent a single double-quote character.
The argument \fB"\^"\fR is explicitly null.
If the desired arguments won't fit on a line,
a concealed newline may be used to continue on the next line.
A trailing double quote may be omitted.
.pg
Similarly, arguments may be passed to strings
with the \fB\e\(**[\fR syntax,
separated by spaces,
until the argument list ends with the \fB]\fR character.
String arguments are otherwise handled exactly like macro arguments.
.pg
When a macro is invoked the \fIinput level\fR is \fIpushed down\fR and
any arguments available at the previous level become unavailable
until the macro is completely read and the previous level is restored.
A macro's own arguments can be interpolated at \fIany\fR point
within the macro with \A'e_$'\fB\e$\fIn\fR,
\fB\e$(\fInn\fR, or \fB\e$[\fInnn\fB]\fR,
which interpolates the \fIn\fRth, \fInn\fRth,
or \fInnn\fRth argument, respectively.
If an invoked argument doesn't exist,
a null string results.
For example, the macro \fIxx\fR may be defined by
.x1

The escape sequence \A'e_$*'\fB\e$\(**\fR interpolates all arguments to a macro,
separated by spaces;
\A'e_$@'\fB\e$@\fR interpolates all arguments,
each one surrounded by double quotes, separated by spaces.
The number of currently available

.pg
No arguments are available at the top (non-macro) level

.pg
Arguments are copied in \T'copy mode'\fIcopy mode\fR\T onto a stack

It is advisable to conceal string references (with an extra \fB\e\fR\|)
to delay interpolation until argument reference time.

\A'c_diversion'Diversions.
Processed output may be diverted into a macro for purposes
such as footnote processing \T'T5'(see Tutorial \(scT5)\T
or determining the horizontal and vertical size of some text for
conditional changing of pages or columns.
A single diversion trap may be set at a specified vertical position.
The number registers \A'n_dn'\fBdn\fR and \A'n_dl'\fBdl\fR
respectively contain the
vertical and horizontal size of the most
recently ended diversion.
Processed text that is diverted into a macro
retains the vertical size of each of its lines when reread
in \fInofill\fR mode
regardless of the current \fIV\fR.
Constant-spaced (\T'cs'\fBcs\fR\T)
or emboldened (\T'bd'\fBbd\fR\T) text that is diverted
can be reread correctly only if these modes are again or still in effect
at reread time.
One way to do this is to imbed in the diversion the appropriate
\T'cs'\fBcs\fR\T or \T'bd'\fBbd\fR requests\T
with the \T'c_transparent'\fItransparent\fR
mechanism described in \(sc10.6.\T
.pg
Diversions may be nested
and certain parameters and registers
are associated
with the current diversion level
(the top non-diversion level may be thought of as the
0th diversion level).
These are the diversion trap and associated macro,
no-space mode,
the internally-saved marked place (see \T'mk'\fBmk\fR\T and \T'rt'\fBrt\fR\T),
the current vertical place (\A'n_.d'\fB.d\fR register),
the current high-water text base-line \T'n_.h'(\fB.h\fR register)\T,
and the current diversion name (\A'n_.z'\fB.z\fR register).
.sc
\A'c_trap'Traps.
Three types of trap mechanisms are available\(empage traps, a diversion trap, and
an input-line-count trap.
Macro-invocation traps may be planted using
\T'wh'\fBwh\fR\T at any page position including the top.
This trap position may be changed using \T'ch'\fBch\fR.\T
Trap positions at or below the bottom of the page
have no effect unless or until
moved to within the page or rendered effective by an increase in page length.
Two traps may be planted at the \fIsame\fR position only by first planting them at different
positions and then moving one of the traps;
the first planted trap will conceal the second unless and until the first one is moved
\T'T5'(see Tutorial Examples \(scT5).\T
If the first one is moved back, it again conceals the second trap.
The macro associated with a page trap is automatically
invoked when a line of text is output whose vertical size \fIreaches\fR
or \fIsweeps past\fR the trap position.
Reaching the bottom of a page springs the top-of-page trap, if any,
provided there is a next page.
The distance to the next trap position is available
in the \A'n_.t'\fB.t\fR register;
if there are no traps between the current position and the bottom of the page,
the distance returned is the distance to the page bottom.
.pg
A macro-invocation trap effective in the current diversion may be planted using \T'dt'\fBdt\fR.\T
The \fB.t\fR register works in a diversion; if there is no subsequent trap a \fIlarge\fR
distance is returned.
For a description of input-line-count traps, see \T'it'\fBit\fR below.\T
.sc
Recursion.
\*(TR macros can be invoked recursively.
In general, return information and arguments for macro calls
are stored as \fIframes\fR on a \fIstack\fR.
Since the size of the stack is limited by available memory,
recursive calls cannot descend to arbitrary depths.
To avoid consumption of large amounts of memory in case of endless loops,
the depth is deliberately restricted further;
the \T'recursionlimit'\fBrecursionlimit\fR\T request
allows to adjust that restriction.
.pg
A macro call can be \fItail-recursive\fR,
that is, the re-invocation of the current macro
can occur in its last statement.
\*(TR can then replace the stack frame
of the current macro instance
with that of the following one,
and the stack size remains constant.
The depth of tail-recursive macro calls is thus principally unlimited,
and is not artificially restricted by default.
Since \*(TR cannot determine the control character
at the time the macro is executed in advance,
the recursive macro call must not only be the last statement of a macro,
but must actually occur in the last line
for tail-recursion elimination to become effective,
although it may be prefixed by \T'if'\fB&if\fR\T or \T'el'\fB&el\fR\T
or followed by \T'e_}'\fB\e}\fR\T.

.mha s_reg
Number Registers
.pg
A variety of parameters are available to the user as
predefined, named \fInumber registers\fR (see Summary and Index, page 7).
In addition, the user may define his own named registers.
Register names are one or two characters long and \fIdo not\fR conflict
with request, macro, or string names.
Except for certain predefined read-only registers,
a number register can be read, written, automatically
incremented or decremented, and interpolated
into the input in a variety of formats.
One common use of user-defined registers is to
automatically number sections, paragraphs, lines, etc.
A number register may be used any time numerical input is expected or desired
and may be used in \T'c_expr'numerical \fIexpressions\fR (\(sc1.4).\T
.pg
Number registers are created and modified using \T'nr'\fBnr\fR\T, which
specifies the name, numerical value, and the auto-increment size.
Registers are also modified, if accessed
with an auto-incrementing sequence.
If the registers \fIx\fR and \fIxx\fR both contain
\fIN\fR and have the auto-increment size \fIM\fR,

Tabs, Leaders, and Fields
.sc
Tabs and leaders.
The \s-1ASCII\s+1 horizontal tab character and the \s-1ASCII\s+1
\s-1SOH\s+1 (hereafter known as the \fIleader\fR character)
can both be used to generate either horizontal motion or
a string of repeated characters.
The length of the generated entity is governed
by internal \fItab stops\fR specifiable
with \T'ta'\fBta\fR\T.
The default difference is that tabs generate motion and leaders generate
a string of periods;
\T'tc'\fBtc\fR\T and \T'lc'\fBlc\fR\T
offer the choice of repeated character or motion.
There are three types of internal tab stops\(em\
\fIleft\fR adjusting, \fIright\fR adjusting,
and \fIcentering\fR.
In the following table,
\fID\fR is the distance from the current position on the \fIinput\fR line
(where a tab or leader was found)
to the next tab stop,
\fInext-string\fR consists
of the input characters following the tab (or leader) up to the next tab (or leader) or end of line,
and
\fIW\fR is the width of \fInext-string\fR.

The length of generated motion is allowed to be negative, but
that of a repeated character string cannot be.
Repeated character strings contain an integer number of characters, and
any residual distance is prepended as motion.
Tabs or leaders found after the last tab stop are ignored, but may be used
as \fInext-string\fR terminators.
.pg
Tabs and leaders are not interpreted in \T'copy mode'\fIcopy mode\fR.\T

.sc
Fields.
A \fIfield\fR is contained between
a \fIpair\fR of \fIfield delimiter\fR characters,
and consists of sub-strings
separated by \fIpadding\fR indicator characters.
The field length is the distance on the
\fIinput\fR line from the position where the field begins to the next tab stop.
The difference between the total length of all the sub-strings
and the field length is incorporated as horizontal
padding space that is divided among the indicated
padding places.
The incorporated padding is allowed to be negative.
For example,
if the field delimiter is \fB#\fR and the padding indicator is \fB^\fR,
\fB#^\fIxxx\fB^\fIright\|\fB#\fR
specifies a right-adjusted string with the string \fIxxx\fR centered

Control characters.
Both the control character \fB.\fR and the \fIno-break\fR

Such a change must be compatible with the design

\A'c_trans'Output translation.
One character can be made a stand-in for another character using \T'tr'\fBtr\fR.\T
All text processing (e. g. character comparisons) takes place

\A'c_transparent'Transparent throughput.
An input line beginning with a \A'e_!'\fB\e!\fR
is read in \T'copy mode'\fIcopy mode\fR\T and \fItransparently\fR output
(without the initial \fB\e!\fR);
the text processor is otherwise unaware of the line's presence.
This mechanism may be used to pass control information to a post-processor
or to imbed control lines in a macro created by a \T'c_diversion'diversion\T.
.h1

.sc
Transparent output.
The sequence \A'e_X'\fB\eX\fI\'anything\'\fR copies \fIanything\fR
to the output,
as a device control function in the form \fBx\ X\ \fIanything\fR
\T's_device'(\(sc25).\T
Escape sequences in \fIanything\fR are processed.
.sc
Comments and concealed newlines.
An uncomfortably long input line that must stay
one line (e. g. a string definition, or nofilled text)
can be split into many physical lines by ending all but
the last one with the escape \fB\e\fR.
The sequence \A'e_newline'\fB\e\fR(newline) is \fIalways\fR ignored\(em\
except in a comment.
Comments may be imbedded at the \fIend\fR of any line by
prefacing them with \A'e_"'\fB\e"\fR.
This form does not conceal the newline at the end of the comment.
A line beginning with \fB\e"\fR will appear as a blank line and
behave like \fB.sp|1\fR;
a comment can be on a line by itself by beginning the line with \fB.\e"\fR.
The form \A'e_#'\fB\e#\fR includes the newline
as part of the comment.
It thus effectively acts like a concealed newline
in concatenating the following line immediately to the current line.

Local Horizontal and Vertical Motions, and the Width Function
.sc
\A'n_.H'\A'n_.V'Local Motions.
The functions \A'e_v'\fB\ev\'\fIN\fB\'\fR and
\A'e_h'\fB\eh\'\fIN\fB\'\fR
can be used for \fIlocal\fR vertical and horizontal motion respectively.
The distance \fIN\fR may be negative; the \fIpositive\fR directions
are \fIrightward\fR and \fIdownward\fR.
A \fIlocal\fR motion is one contained \fIwithin\fR a line.
To avoid unexpected vertical dislocations, it is necessary that
the \fInet\fR vertical local motion within a word in filled text
and otherwise within a line balance to zero.
The above and certain other escape sequences providing local motion are

As an example,

could be generated by the sequence

note that the 0.4|em vertical motions are at the smaller size.
.sc
\A'c_width'Width Function.
The \fIwidth\fR function \A'e_w'\fB\ew\'\fIstring\fB\|\'\fR
generates the numerical width of \fIstring\fR (in basic units).
Size and font changes may be safely imbedded in \fIstring\fR,
and will not affect the current environment.
For example,
\&\fB.ti|\-\\w\'\efB1.|\'u\fR could be used to
temporarily indent leftward a distance equal to the
size of the string "\fB1.|\fR" in font \fBB\fR.
.pg
The width function also sets three number registers.
The registers \A'n_st'\fBst\fR and \A'n_sb'\fBsb\fR
are set respectively to the highest and
lowest extent of \fIstring\fR relative to the baseline;
then, for example,
the total \fIheight\fR of the string is \fB\en(stu\-\en(sbu\fR.
In \*(TR the number register \A'n_ct'\fBct\fR is set to a value
between 0|and|3:
0 means that all of the characters in \fIstring\fR were short lower
case characters without descenders (like \fBe\fR);
1 means that at least one character has a descender (like \fBy\fR);
2 means that at least one character is tall (like \fBH\fR);
and 3 means that both tall characters and characters with
descenders are present.
.pg
The \A'n_.w'\fB.w\fR number register contains
the width of the previous character
independently of the width function.
.sc
Mark horizontal place.
The escape sequence \A'e_k'\fB\ek\fIx\fR will cause the \fIcurrent\fR horizontal
position in the \fIinput line\fR to be stored in register \fIx\fR.
As an example,
the construction \fB\ekx\fIword\|\fB\eh\'\|~\|\enxu+3u\'\fIword\fB\fR
will embolden \fIword\fR by backing up to almost its beginning and overprinting it,
resulting in \kz\fIword\fR\h'|\nzu+2u'\fIword\fR.
Likewise, \fB\ek(\fIxx\fR and \fB\ek[\fIxxx\fB]\fR
will store the horizontal position in register \fIxx\fR or \fIxxx\fR,
respectively.
The \A'n_hp'\fBhp\fR number register also holds
the current horizontal position in the input line.
.mha s_draw
Overstrike, Bracket, Line-drawing, Graphics, and Zero-width Functions
.sc
\A'c_overstrike'Overstriking.
Automatically centered overstriking of up to nine characters
is provided by the \fIoverstrike\fR function
\A'e_o'\fB\eo\'\fIstring\fB\|\'\fR.
The characters in \fIstring\fR overprinted with centers aligned; the total width
is that of the widest character.
\fIstring\fR may \fInot\fR contain local vertical motion.
As examples,
\fB\eo\'e\e\'\'\fR produces \fB\o'e\''\fR, and
\fB\eo\'\e(mo\e(sl\'\fR produces \fB\o'\(mo\(sl'\fR.
.sc
Zero-width characters.
The function \A'e_z'\fB\ez\fIc\fR will output \fIc\fR without spacing over
it, and can be used to produce left-aligned overstruck
combinations.
As examples,
\fB\ez\e(ci\e(pl\fR will produce \fB\z\(ci\(pl\fR, and
\fB\e(br\ez\e(rn\e(ul\e(br\fR will produce the smallest possible
constructed box \fB\(br\z\(rn\(ul\(br\fR\|.
.sc
Large Brackets.
The Special Font contains a number of bracket construction pieces
(\|\|\(lt\|\|\(lb\|\|\(rt\|\|\(rb\|\|\(lk\|\|\(rk\|\|\(bv\|\|\(lf\|\|\(rf\|\|\(lc\|\|\(rc\|\|)
that can be combined into various bracket styles.
The function \A'e_b'\fB\eb\'\fIstring\fB\|\'\fR may be used to pile
up vertically the characters in \fIstring\fR
(the first character on top and the last at the bottom);
the characters are vertically separated by 1|em and the total
pile is centered 1/2\|em above the current baseline
(\(12 line in \*(NR).
For example,
\fB\eb\'\|\e(lc\e(lf\|\'E\e\|~\|\eb\'\|\e(rc\e(rf\|\'\|\ex\'\|\-0.5m\'\|\ex\'0.5m\'\|\fR
produces
\x'-.5m'\x'.5m'\fB\b'\(lc\(lf'E\|\b'\(rc\(rf'\fR.
.sc
\A'c_line'Line drawing.
.tr &&
The function \A'e_l'\fB\e\|l\^\'\fINc\fB\'\fR (backslash-ell)
will draw a string of repeated \fIc\fR\|'s towards the right for a distance \fIN\fR.
If \fIc\fR looks like a continuation of
an \T'c_expr'expression\T for \fIN\fR,
it may insulated from \fIN\fR with a \fB\e&\fR.
If \fIc\fR is not specified, the \fB\(ru\fR (baseline rule) is used
(underline character in \*(NR).
If \fIN\fR is negative, a backward horizontal motion
of size \fIN\fR is made \fIbefore\fR drawing the string.
Any space resulting from \fIN\fR\|/(size of \fIc\fR) having a remainder is put at the beginning (left end)
of the string.
If \fIN\fR is less than the width of \fIc\fR,
a single \fIc\fR is centered on a distance \fIN\fR.
In the case of characters
that are designed to be connected such as
baseline-rule\ \fB\(ru\fR\|,
underrule\ \fB\(ul\fR\|,
and
root-en\ \fB\(rn\fR\|,
the remainder space is covered by over-lapping.
If \fIN\fR is \fIless\fR than the width of \fIc\fR,
a single \fIc\fR is centered on a distance \fIN\fR.
As an example, a macro to underscore a string can be written
.br

.pg
The function \A'e_L'\fB\eL\'\fINc\fB\'\fR draws a vertical line consisting
of the (optional) character \fIc\fR stacked vertically apart 1\|em
(1 line in \*(NR),
with the first two characters overlapped,
if necessary, to form a continuous line.
The default character is the \fIbox rule\fR |\(br| (\fB\|\e(br\fR);
the other suitable character is the \fIbold vertical\fR \|\(bv\| (\fB\|\e(bv\fR).
The line is begun without any initial motion relative to the
current base line.
A positive \fIN\fR specifies a line drawn downward and
a negative \fIN\fR specifies a line drawn upward.
After the line is drawn \fIno\fR compensating
motions are made;
the instantaneous baseline is at the \fIend\fR of the line.

Hyphenation.
.pg
Automatic hyphenation may be switched off and on.
When switched on with \T'hy'\fBhy\fR\T,
several variants may be set.
A \fIhyphenation indicator\fR character,
by default \A'e_%'\fB\e%\fR,
may be imbedded in a word to
specify desired hyphenation points,
or may be prefixed to suppress hyphenation.
The character \A'e_:'\fB\e:\fR indicates that a line break may
optionally occur at a point,
but that no hyphen is to be generated.
In addition,
the user may specify a small list of exception words.
.pg
Only words that consist of a central alphabetic string
surrounded by (usually null) non-alphabetic strings
are considered candidates for automatic hyphenation.
Unless the set of optional line break characters is otherwise configured,
words that contain hyphens
(minus),
em-dashes (\fB\e(em\fR),

are \fIalways\fR subject to splitting after those characters,

For \fIN=\fR\|4 and 8, the last and first two characters

For \fIN=\fR\|16 and 32, the last and first characters

this is only effective for explicit hyphenation points

Automatic sequence numbering of output lines may be

.TE
If the condition \fIc\fR is \fItrue\fR, or if the number \fIN\fR is greater than zero,
or if the strings compare identically (including motions and character size and font),
\fIanything\fR is accepted as input.
If a \fB!\fR precedes the condition, number, or string comparison,
the sense of the acceptance is reversed.
.pg
Any spaces between the condition and the beginning of \fIanything\fR are skipped over.
The \fIanything\fR can be either a single input line (text, macro, or whatever)
or a number of input lines.
In the multi-line case,
the first line must begin with a left delimiter \A'e_{'\fB\e{\fR and
the last line must end with a right delimiter \A'e_}'\fB\e}\fR.
.pg
The request \T'ie'\fBie\fR\T (if-else) is identical to \T'if'\fBif\fR\T
except that the acceptance state is remembered.
A subsequent and matching \T'el'\fBel\fR\T (else) request then uses the reverse sense of that state.
\fBie\fR|-|\fBel\fR pairs may be nested.
.pg
Some examples are:

Environment Switching.
.pg
A number of the parameters that
control the text processing are gathered together into an
\fIenvironment\fR, which can be switched by the user.
The environment parameters are those associated
with requests noting E in their \fINotes\fR column;
in addition, partially collected lines and words are in the environment.
Everything else is global; examples are page-oriented parameters,
\T'c_diversion'diversion\T-oriented parameters,
number registers, and macro and string definitions.
All environments are initialized with default parameter values.
The number of possible environments is only limited by available memory.

Insertions from the Standard Input
.pg
The input can be temporarily switched to the system \fIstandard input\fR
with \T'rd'\fBrd\fR\T,
which will switch back when \fItwo\fR newlines
in a row are found (the \fIextra\fR blank line is not used).
This mechanism is intended for insertions in form-letter-like documentation.
The \fIstandard input\fR can be the user's keyboard,

.pg
As an example,
multiple copies of a form letter may be prepared by entering the insertions

Various \fIerror\fR conditions may occur during
the operation of \*(NR and \*[TR.]
Certain less serious errors having only local impact do not
cause processing to terminate.
Two examples are \fIword overflow\fR, caused by a word that is too large
to fit into the word buffer (in fill mode), and
\fIline overflow\fR, caused by an output line that grew too large
to fit in the line buffer;
in both cases, a message is printed, the offending excess
is discarded,
and the affected word or line is marked at the point of truncation
with a \(** in \*(NR and a \(lh in \*[TR.]
Processing continues if possible,
on the grounds that output useful for debugging may be produced.
If a serious error occurs, processing terminates,
and an appropriate message is printed,
along with a list of the macro names currently active.
Examples are the inability to create, read, or write files,
and the exceeding of certain internal limits that
make future output unlikely to be useful.

While \*(TR does not support colors directly,
\fIdpost\fR is able to embed arbitrary \*(PS color instructions

`\eX\'PSSetup: $setcolorspace {.\|.\|.} bind def\''
escape sequence.
This parameter is required if the color space changes
in the document.
Otherwise, it may be sufficient
to install the color space once in the setup section.
.pg
Each parameter must be a number in the range between 0.0 and 1.0.
In the most general case, the value of the
.I color
argument is passed to the \*(PS output without interpretation.
.pg
Both the text and background color can be selected.
A
.I color
argument of ``\fIcolor1\fR'' \fBon\fR ``\fIcolor2\fR''
prints text in
.I color1

.I color2.
.pg
The initial color is black in the \fIDeviceGray\fR color space,
i.e. the same as ``0 setgray''.
Once a color is in effect,
it is re-installed at the top of each output page.
.pg
The \fB\-mcolor\fR macro package
adds another access method to
the capabilities of color selection
and reverse video printing.
It includes the following macro:
.h1
.bta CL
\fB&CL\fI|color|text\fR	\s-1RGB\s+1|black		Print \fItext\fR in \fIcolor\fR.
No arguments restores a default color
(black in \s-1RGB\s+1 color space;
note that this is different from the initial color).
If
.I text
is omitted the selected
.I color
remains in effect until another
.I color
is selected.
If two arguments are given the
.I text
is printed in
.I color
and then the default color is restored.

Special Features for \*[PDF] Documents
.pg
.sc
The basics.
\*(TR does not directly generate \*[PDF] documents;
the \fIdpost\fR postprocessor generates \*(PS output
which can be converted to \*[PDF] by
utilities like Ghostscript's \fIps2pdf\fR or Adobe Distiller.
But it is possible to include special advices
to this conversion program in \*(PS
using the \fBpdfmark\fR operator.
Such advices are generated automatically by some \*(TR requests,
e.g. by \T'cropat'\fBcropat\fR\T \T's_page'(\(sc3).\T
Other advices can be given explicitly using the
\fB\eX\'PS:\fR...\fB\'\fR
or
\fB\eX\'PDFMark:\fR...\fB\'\fR
escape sequences.
.pg
.sc
Preparations.
When generating PDF files,
it is especially important to set the paper format
using the \T'mediasize'\fBmediasize\fR\T request \T's_page'(\(sc3).\T
This is because calculations in \*[PDF] documents
are generally performed in relation regard to the page bottom,
while \*(TR performs its calculations in relation to the page top.
Failing to set the paper format correctly
will thus usually result in vertical displacements
of \*[PDF]-specific elements.
.pg
.sc
\A'c_pdfdescr'Specifying document description items.
PDF documents can include meta-data about author, title etc.
To generate such data,
use the \fBPDFMark\fR device command of \fIdpost\fR
with the \*(TR \T'e_X'\fB\eX\fR escape sequence\T, e.g.\&
.x1
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: Author \fIMy Name\fB\'
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: Keywords \fITypesetting, PDF documents\fB\'
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: Subject \fItroff, dpost, and pdfmark\fB\'
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: Title \fISpecial features for PDF documents\fB\'
\fB&br\fR
.x2
.xx
Unicode characters are accepted in these text strings.
Note that whitespace and newlines surrounding \fB\eX\fR escape sequences
are considered to be input text by \*[TR,]
and need a \fIbreak\fR before they are output.
To avoid inserting superfluous spaces or line breaks,
specify this information before an initial
\fB&sp \(or\en[topmargin]u\fR request or the like in the document.
.pg
.sc
Direct use of the pdfmark operator.
In cases where \*(TR or \fIdpost\fR do not
include an explicit mechanism for \*[PDF] features,
it is possible to call the \fBpdfmark\fR operator directly.
Examples are:
.xx
.in +2m
.ti -2m
.ne 2
.nr nosave 1
\fB\eX\'PS: [ {Catalog} << /ViewerPreferences << /DisplayDocTitle true >> >> /PUT pdfmark\e'\fR
.br
.nr nosave 0
This causes the \*[PDF] viewer to print the document title
\T'c_pdfdescr'(as in \(sc24.3)\T in the application title bar
instead of the \*[PDF] file name.
.xx
.ti -2m
.nr nosave 1
.ne 2
\fB\eX\'PS: [ /PageMode /UseOutlines /DOCVIEW pdfmark\'\fR
.br
.nr nosave 0
This causes the \*[PDF] viewer to display the bookmarks toolbar
when the document is opened.
Other interesting values are
\fB/UseNone\fR (the default),
\fB/UseThumbs\fR (display page thumbnails),
and \fB/FullScreen\fR (open the document in full-screen mode).
.xx
.ti -2m
.nr nosave 1
.ne 2
\fB\eX\'PS: [ /PageMode /Page \fIN\fB /View [/XYZ null null null] /DOCVIEW pdfmark\'\fR
.br
.nr nosave 0
Page \fIN\fR is displayed instead of the first page
when the document is opened.
.xx
.ti -2m
.nr nosave 1
.ne 2
\fB\eX\'PS: [ {Catalog} << /PageLayout /TwoPageRight >> /PUT pdfmark\'\fR
.br
.nr nosave 0
With this command,
the \*[PDF] viewer displays two pages at once.
Other interesting values are
\fB/SinglePage\fR (display one page at once),
\fB/OneColumn\fR (display one page in continuous mode),
and
\fB/TwoColumnRight\fR (display two pages in continuous mode).
.xx
.ti -2m
.nr nosave 1
\fB\eX\'PS: [ /Label (\fItext\fB) /PAGELABEL pdfmark\'\fR
.br
.nr nosave 0
The given \s-1ASCII\s+1 \fItext\fR is shown next to the page number
of the current page
in the \*[PDF] viewer toolbar.
This is particularly useful to implement roman page numbers
in \*[PDF] documents
in combination with the \T'af'\fBaf\fR\T request.
.in -2m
.pg
.sc
Creating bookmarks.
Bookmarks are usually shown by the \*[PDF] viewer at the left of the
window.
When you create \*[PDF] files longer than a few pages for viewing
on the screen, you should include bookmarks for each chapter or section
because they enable the reader to navigate much more conveniently.
.pg
Start with a bookmark for the title page.
``0'' is the level of the bookmark in the tree structure,
and the following arguments form the name of the bookmark:
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: Bookmark \fI0 Title\fB\'\fR.
Similar to the description specifications above, this bookmark should
appear before the top margin of the title page.
.pg
When generating bookmarks for chapters and sections, it is usually most
practical to include the command in the chapter/section macros:
.x1
&de CH
&	bp
\ev\'\(or\-1v\-4p\'\e\eX\'PDFMark: Bookmark 0 \e\e$1\'
&	sp \(or\e\en[topmargin]u
&	ce
&	sp
&.
&de SH
&	ce
\e\e$1\ev\'\-1v\'\e\eX\'PDFMark: Bookmark 1 \e\e$1\'
&	sp
&.
.x2
Unless the bookmark command occurs at the top of the page,
it refers to the baseline of the text;
this is why a \fB\ev\'\-1v\'\fR command occurs
before it in the section macro.
\fB\ev\'\-1v\-4p\'\fR at the top of the page
is a special value that causes the upper left corner to be shown.
.pg
The level of the first bookmark in a document must be of level 0.
The levels of following bookmarks must be either
.xx
.nr w \w'\(en\ '
.in +\nwu
.ti -\nwu
\(en\ one higher than the level of the previous bookmark.
The new bookmark then becomes a child of the previous bookmark.
.xx
.ti -\nwu
\(en\ equal to the level of the previous bookmark.
In this case, both bookmarks are grouped
below the first previous bookmark of the first higher level,
or at the top level for level 0.
.xx
.ti -\nwu
\(en\ lower than the level of the previous bookmark.
This terminates the list of children of the higher levels.
.in -\nwu
.pg
As an example, the following level structure is legal, and causes the
PDF viewer to group the bookmarks as shown:
.xx
.nf
.lc \-
.ta 1i 1i+3m 1i+6m 1i+9m
	 0			title page
	 0			Chapter 1
	 \(bu1		Section 1.1
	 \(bu1		Section 1.2
	 \(or	\(bu2	Subsection 1.2.1
	 \(or	\(bu2	Subsection 1.2.2
	 \(or	\(bu2	Subsection 1.2.3
	 \(bu1		Section 1.3
	 	\(bu2	Subsection 1.3.1
	 	\(bu2	Subsection 1.3.2
	 0			Chapter 2
	 \(bu1		Section 2.1
	 0			Index
.fi
.pg
In case of an illegal structure in which the level of a bookmark is
raised by more than one above its predecessor,
\fIdpost\fR emits a warning and assigns the highest legal level.
However, a garbled document structure may result:
.xx
.nf
	 0
	 \(bu2		\(lh the first level 2 is corrected to 1 by \fIdpost\fR
	 	\(bu2	so the second bookmark becomes a child of the first
.fi
.xx
.lc
Thus such \fIdpost\fR warnings should usually be taken seriously, and the
document should be corrected.
.pg
An alternate form of bookmarks,
\fB\eX\'PDFMark: BookmarkClosed \fR...\fB\'\fR,
is available.
The syntax is the same,
but the initial view in the tree structure is collapsed,
i.e. no children are shown by default.
It the bookmark has no children,
there is no difference to a regular bookmark.
.sc
Links.
\*[PDF] documents can contain links
that cause the viewer to jump to a certain location
when the user clicks on an area of the page.
In \*[TR,] such links can be built as follows:
.pg
The \A'e_A'\fB\eA\fI\'string\'\fR escape sequence defines an anchor,
i.e. a location to jump to,
with the name \fIstring\fR
(consisting of \s-1ASCII\s0 characters).
.pg
The actual link is built using two \A'e_T'\fB\eT\fR escape
sequences surrounding the text that forms the area to click on,
e.g.: \fB\eT\fI\'string\'text of link\fB\eT\fR.
\fIstring\fR must correspond to an anchor
anywhere in the document.
.pg
The appearance of links can be changed;
links are normally surrounded by an 1 point wide blue border.
The color can be set using
\fB\eX'SetLinkColor: \fIred green blue\fB'\fR,
where \fIred, green, and blue\fR are values between 0 and 1.
The border can be set using
\fB\eX'SetLinkBorder: \fIbx by width\fB'\fR,
where \fIbx\fR and \fIby\fR define the horizontal
and vertical corner radius, respectively,
and \fIwidth\fR defines the width.
.\"""
.pg
.mha s_output
Output Language.
.pg
\*(TR
produces its output in a language that is independent of any
specific output device,
except that the numbers in it have been computed on the basis
of the resolution of the device,
and the sizes, fonts, and characters that that device can print.
Nevertheless it is quite possible to interpret that output
on a different device, within the latter's capabilities.

Device and Font Description Files
.pg
The parameters that describe a output device \fIname\fR
are read from the directory
\fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev\fIname\fR,
each time
\*(TR
is invoked.
The device name is provided by default,
by the environment variable \fB\s-1TYPESETTER\s+1\fR,
or by a command-line argument \fB\-T\fIname\fR.
The default device name is \fBps\fR,
for \*(PS output at a resolution of 72\|000\ dpi.
The pre-defined string \fB.T\fR
contains the name of the device.
The \fB\-F\fR
command-line option may be used to change the default directory.
.sc

.pg
General parameters of the device are stored, one per line, in
the file \fB/usr/ucblib/doctools/font/dev\fIname\^\fB/DESC\fR,

\*(TR recognizes these parameters, and ignores any
others that may be present for specific drivers:

\fBcharset\fR
\fIlist of multi-character character names (optional)\fP
.pg
The F, G, ... are font names
to be initially mounted.
The list of sizes is a set of integers representing
some or all of the legal sizes the device can produce,
terminated by a zero.
The  \fBres\fR
parameter gives the resolution of the machine in units per inch;
\fBhor\fR and \fBver\fR
give the minimum number of units that can be moved
horizontally and vertically.
.pg
Character widths for each font are assumed to be given in machine units
at point size \fBunitwidth\fR.
(In other words, a character with a width of
\fIn\fR is \fIn\fR units wide at size \fBunitwidth\fR.)
All widths are integers at all sizes.
.pg
A list of valid character names may be introduced by \fBcharset\fR;
the list of names is optional.
.pg
A line whose first non-blank character is \fB#\fR is a comment.

Note: This description applies to the old

The current version of \*(TR usually reads font metrics
directly from Type\ 1, OpenType, or TrueType font files,
as described for the \T'fp'\fBfp\fR\T request \T's_font'(\(sc2)\T
and in the separate fonts manual available from the project home page.
.pg
Each font is described by an analogous description file,
which begins with parameters of the font, one per line, followed by a
list of characters and widths.
The file for font \fIF\fR

.nr nosave 0
\fBcharset\fR
\fIlist of character name, width, ascender/descender, code\fP, tab separated
.pg
The \fBname\fR and \fBcharset\fR
fields are mandatory;
\fBcharset\fR must be last.
Comments are permitted,
as are other unrecognized parameters.
.pg
Each line following \fRcharset\fR
describes one character: its name, its width in units as described above,
ascender/descender information, and a decimal, octal or hexadecimal value
by which the output device knows it
(the \T'e_N'\fB\eN\fR\T
``number'' of the character).
The character name is arbitrary, except that \fB\-\-\-\fR
signifies an unnamed character.
If the width field contains \fB"\fR,
the name is a synonym for the previous character.
The ascender/descender field is 1 if
the character has a descender (hangs below the baseline, like \fBy\fR),
is 2 if it has an ascender (is tall, like \fBY\fR),
is 3 if both,
and is 0 if neither.
The value is returned
in the \T'n_ct'\fBct\fR\T register,
as computed by the \T'e_w'\fB\ew\fR
function\T \T'c_width'(\(sc11.2).\T

This says, for example, that the width of the letter \fBa\fR
is 44 units at point size 10,
the value of \fBunitwidth\fR.
Point sizes are scaled linearly and rounded, so the width of \fBa\fR
will be 44 at size 10, 40 at size 9, 35 at size 8,
and so on.

Introduction
.pg
Although \*(NR and \*(TR
have by design a syntax reminiscent
of earlier text processors*
.fn
.xx
*For example:
P.|A.|Crisman, Ed.,
.ul
The Compatible Time-Sharing System,
MIT Press, 1965, Section|AH9.01
(Description of RUNOFF program on MIT's CTSS system).
.ef
with the intent of easing their use,
it is almost always necessary to
prepare at least a small set of macro definitions
to describe most documents.
Such common formatting needs
as page margins and footnotes
are deliberately not built into \*(NR and \*[TR.]
Instead,
the macro and string definition, number register, \T'c_diversion'diversion\T,
environment switching, page-position trap, and conditional input mechanisms
provide the basis for user-defined implementations.
.pg
The examples to be discussed are intended to be useful and somewhat realistic,
but won't necessarily cover all relevant contingencies.
Explicit numerical parameters are used
in the examples
to make them easier to read and to
illustrate typical values.
In many cases, number registers would really be used
to reduce the number of places where numerical
information is kept,
and to concentrate conditional parameter initialization
like that which depends on whether \*(TR or \*(NR is being used.
.mha T2
Page Margins
.pg
As discussed in \T's_page'\(sc3,\T
\fIheader\fR and \fIfooter\fR macros are usually defined
to describe the top and bottom page margin areas respectively.
A trap is planted at page position 0 for the header, and at
\fI\-N\fR (\fIN\fR from the page bottom) for the footer.
The simplest such definitions might be
.x1
&de hd	\e"define header
\'sp 1i
&&	\e"end definition
&de fo	\e"define footer
\'bp
&&	\e"end definition
&wh 0 hd
&wh \-1i fo
.x2
which provide blank 1|inch top and bottom margins.
The header will occur on the \fIfirst\fR page,
only if the definition and trap exist prior to
the initial pseudo-page transition \T's_page'(\(sc3).\T
In fill mode, the output line that springs the footer trap
was typically forced out because some part or whole word didn't fit on it.
If anything in the footer and header that follows causes a \fIbreak\fR,
that word or part word will be forced out.
In this and other examples,
requests like \T'bp'\fBbp\fR\T and \T'sp'\fBsp\fR\T
that normally cause breaks are invoked using
the \fIno-break\fR control character \fB\'\fR
to avoid this.
When the header/footer design contains material
requiring independent text processing, the
environment may be switched, avoiding
most interaction with the running text.
.pg
A more realistic example would be
.x1
&de hd	\e"header
&if t .tl \'\e(rn\'\'\e(rn\'  \e"troff cut mark
&if \e\en%>1 \e{\e
\'sp ~\|0.5i\-1	\e"tl base at 0.5i
&tl \'\'\- % \-\'\'	\e"centered page number
&ps	\e"restore size
&ft	\e"restore font
&vs  \e}	\e"restore vs
\'sp ~\|1.0i  	\e"space to 1.0i
&ns	\e"turn on no-space mode
&&
&de fo	\e"footer
&ps 10	\e"set footer/header size
&ft R	\e"set font
&vs 12p	\e"set base-line spacing
&if \e\en%=1 \e{\e
\'sp ~\|\e\en(.pu\-0.5i\-1  \e"tl base 0.5i up
&tl \'\'\- % \-\'\' \e}  \e"first page number
\'bp
&&
&wh 0 hd
&wh \-1i fo
.x2
which sets the size, font, and base-line spacing for the
header/footer material, and ultimately restores them.
The material in this case is a page number at the bottom of the
first page and at the top of the remaining pages.
If \*(TR is used, a \fIcut mark\fR is drawn in the form
of \fIroot-en\fR's at each margin.
The \T'sp'\fBsp\fR's\T refer to absolute positions to avoid
dependence on the base-line spacing.
Another reason for this in the footer
is that the footer is invoked by printing a line whose
vertical spacing swept past the trap position by possibly
as much as the base-line spacing.
The \fIno-space\fR mode is turned on at the end of \fBhd\fR
to render ineffective
accidental occurrences of \T'sp'\fBsp\fR\T at the top of the running text.
.pg
The above method of restoring size, font, etc. presupposes
that such requests (that set \fIprevious\fR value) are \fInot\fR
used in the running text.
A better scheme is save and restore both the current \fIand\fR
previous values as shown for size in the following:
.x1
&de fo
&nr s1 \e\en(.s	\e"current size
&ps
&nr s2 \e\en(.s	\e"previous size
&  ---	\e"rest of footer
&&
&de hd
&  ---	\e"header stuff
&ps \e\en(s2	\e"restore previous size
&ps \e\en(s1	\e"restore current size
&&
.x2
Page numbers may be printed in the bottom margin
by a separate macro triggered during the footer's
page ejection:
.x1
&de bn	\e"bottom number
&tl \'\'\- % \-\'\'	\e"centered page number
&&
&wh \-0.5i\-1v bn	 \e"tl base 0.5i up
.x2
.mha T3
Paragraphs and Headings
.pg
The housekeeping
associated with starting a new paragraph should be collected
in a paragraph macro
that, for example,
does the desired preparagraph spacing,
forces the correct font, size, base-line spacing, and indent,
checks that enough space remains for \fImore than one\fR line,
and
requests a temporary indent.
.x1
&de pg	\e"paragraph
&br	\e"break
&ft R	\e"force font,
&ps 10	\e"size,
&vs 12p	\e"spacing,
&in 0	\e"and indent
&sp 0.4	\e"prespace
&ne 1+\e\en(.Vu	\e"want more than 1 line
&ti 0.2i	\e"temp indent
&&
.x2
The first break in \fBpg\fR
will force out any previous partial lines,
and must occur before the \T'vs'\fBvs\fR\T.
The forcing of font, etc. is
partly a defense against prior error and
partly to permit
things like section heading macros to
set parameters only once.
The prespacing parameter is suitable for \*[TR;]
a larger space, at least as big as the output device vertical resolution, would be
more suitable in \*[NR.]
The choice of remaining space to test for in the \T'ne'\fBne\fR\T
is the smallest amount greater than one line
(the \T'n_.V'\fB.V\fR\T is the available vertical resolution).
.pg
A macro to automatically number section headings
might look like:
.x1
&de sc	\e"section
&  ---	\e"force font, etc.
&sp 0.4	\e"prespace
&ne 2.4+\e\en(.Vu \e"want 2.4+ lines
.lg 0
&fi
.lg
\e\en+S.
&&
&nr S 0 1	\e"init S
.x2
The usage is \fB.sc\fR,
followed by the section heading text,
followed by \fB.pg\fR.
The \T'ne'\fBne\fR\T test value includes one line of heading,
0.4 line in the following \fBpg\fR, and
one line of the paragraph text.
A word consisting of the next section number and a period is
produced to begin the heading line.
The format of the number may be set by \T'af'\fBaf\fR\T \T's_reg'(\(sc8).\T
.pg
Another common form is the labeled, indented paragraph,
where the label protrudes left into the indent space.
.x1
&de lp	\e"labeled paragraph
&pg
&in 0.5i	\e"paragraph indent
&ta 0.2i 0.5i	\e"label, paragraph
&ti 0
\et\e\e$1\et\ec	\e"flow into paragraph
&&
.x2
The intended usage is "\fB.lp\fR \fIlabel\fR\|";
\fIlabel\fR will begin at 0.2\|inch, and
cannot exceed a length of 0.3\|inch without intruding into
the paragraph.
The label could be right adjusted against 0.4\|inch by
setting the tabs instead with \fB.ta|0.4iR|0.5i\fR.
The last line of \fBlp\fR ends with \fB\ec\fR so that
it will become a part of the first line of the text
that follows.
.mha T4
Multiple Column Output
.pg
The production of multiple column pages requires
the footer macro to decide whether it was
invoked by other than the last column,
so that it will begin a new column rather than
produce the bottom margin.
The header can initialize a column register that
the footer will increment and test.
The following is arranged for two columns, but
is easily modified for more.
.x1
&de hd	\e"header
&  ---
&nr cl 0 1	\e"init column count
&mk	\e"mark top of text
&&
&de fo	\e"footer
&ie \e\en+(cl<2 \e{\e
&po +3.4i	\e"next column; 3.1+0.3
&rt	\e"back to mark
&ns \e}	\e"no-space mode
&el \e{\e
&po \e\enMu	\e"restore left margin
&  ---
\'bp \e}
&&
&ll 3.1i	\e"column width
&nr M \e\en(.o	\e"save left margin
.x2
Typically a portion of the top of the first page
contains full width text;
the request for the narrower line length,
as well as another \fB.mk\fR would
be made where the two column output was to begin.
.mha T5
Footnote Processing
.pg
The footnote mechanism to be described is used by
imbedding the footnotes in the input text at the
point of reference,
demarcated by an initial \fB.fn\fR and a terminal \fB.ef\fR:
.x1
&fn
\fIFootnote text and control lines...\fP
&ef
.x2
In the following,
footnotes are processed in a separate environment and diverted
for later printing in the space immediately prior to the bottom
margin.
There is provision for the case where the last collected
footnote doesn't completely fit in the available space.
.x1
&de hd	\e"header
&  ---
&nr x 0 1	\e"init footnote count
&nr y 0\-\e\enb	\e"current footer place
&ch fo \-\e\enbu	\e"reset footer trap
&if \e\en(dn .fz	\e"leftover footnote
&&
&de fo	\e"footer

&if \e\enx .di fy	\e"divert overflow

&ch fo \e\enyu	\e"y is negative
&if (\|\e\en(nl+1v)>(\|\e\en(.p+\e\eny) \e

&wh 12i fo	\e"footer trap, temp position
&wh \-\e\enbu fx	\e"fx at footer position
&ch fo \-\e\enbu	\e"conceal fx with fo
.x2
The header \fBhd\fR initializes a footnote count register \fBx\fR,
and sets both the current footer trap position register \fBy\fR and
the footer trap itself to a nominal position specified in
register \fBb\fR.
In addition, if the register \T'n_dn'\fBdn\fR\T indicates a leftover footnote,
\fBfz\fR is invoked to reprocess it.
The footnote start macro \fBfn\fR begins a
\T'c_diversion'diversion\T (append) in environment 1,
and increments the count \fBx\fR; if the count is one, the footnote separator \fBfs\fR
is interpolated.
The separator is kept in a separate macro to permit user redefinition.
The footnote end macro \fBef\fR restores
the previous environment and ends the \T'c_diversion'diversion\T
after saving the spacing size in register \fBz\fR.
\fBy\fR is then decremented by the size of the footnote,
available in \T'n_dn'\fBdn\fR\T;
then on the first footnote, \fBy\fR is further decremented by the difference
in vertical base-line spacings of the two environments, to
prevent the late triggering the footer trap from causing the last
line of the combined footnotes to overflow.
The footer trap is then set to the lower (on the page) of \fBy\fR or the current page position \T'n_nl'(\fBnl\fR)\T
plus one line, to allow for printing the reference line.
If indicated by \fBx\fR, the footer \fBfo\fR rereads the footnotes from \fBFN\fR in nofill mode
in environment 1,
and deletes \fBFN\fR.
If the footnotes were too large to fit, the macro \fBfx\fR will be trap-invoked to redivert
the overflow into \fBfy\fR,
and the register \T'n_dn'\fBdn\fR\T will later indicate
to the header whether \fBfy\fR is empty.
Both \fBfo\fR and \fBfx\fR are planted in the nominal footer trap position in an order
that causes \fBfx\fR to be concealed unless the \fBfo\fR trap is moved.
The footer then terminates the overflow \T'c_diversion'diversion\T,
if necessary, and
zeros \fBx\fR to disable \fBfx\fR,
because the uncertainty correction
together with a not-too-late triggering of the footer can result
in the footnote rereading finishing before reaching the \fBfx\fR trap.
.pg
A good exercise for the student is to combine the multiple-column and footnote mechanisms.
.mha T6
The Last Page
.pg
After the last input file has ended, \*(NR and \*(TR
invoke the \fIend macro\fR \T's_mac'(\(sc7),\T if any,
and when it finishes, eject the remainder of the page.
During the eject, any traps encountered are processed normally.
At the \fIend\fR of this last page, processing terminates
\fIunless\fR a partial line, word, or partial word remains.
If it is desired that another page be started, the end-macro
.x1
&de en	\e"end-macro
\ec
\'bp
&&
&em en
.x2
will deposit a null partial word,
and effect another last page.
