README for the Heirloom Troff Justification Documentation
=========================================================

To build this manual, you need the Adobe Garamond Pro fonts,
and need to set the TROFFONTS variable accordingly. Adobe
Garamond Pro is available as part of the "Adobe Type Basics
OpenType Edition" package.

Note that as of autumn 2005, it was not possible to
download fonts bought directly from Adobe using a Linux
system. There are many other shops that sell Adobe fonts,
though, and these usually allow downloads for Linux users.
