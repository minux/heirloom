Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations,
are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest.
But even our commercial policy
should hold an equal and impartial hand;
neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences;
consulting the natural course of things;
diffusing and diversifying by gentle means
the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing;
establishing with powers so disposed,
in order to give to trade a stable course,
to define the rights of our merchants,
and to enable the government to support them,
conventional roules of intercourse,
the best that present circumstances
and mutual opinion will permit,
but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied,
as experience and circumstances shall dictate;
constantly keeping in view,
that it is folly in one nation
to look for disinterested favor from another;
that it must pay with a portion of its independence
for whatever it may accept under that character;
that by such acceptance,

.S "Line-by-line adjustment"
.nr print-pageno 1
.P
When determining line breaks,
\*(TR traditionally uses a simple method:
Words are accumulated from input
as long as they fit on the current output line.
Once a word consumes more space
than available,
it is hyphenated.
If a feasible breakpoint results,
it is chosen;
otherwise the current output line ends with the previous word.
.P
If the adjustment mode is ``b''
(adjust both margins)
and the line is shorter than the desired line length,
interword spaces are widened
to make the line fit.
The line is then printed
either to intermediate output
or to the current diversion, if any.
Afterwards, the process starts again.
.P
This method works reasonably well
but has two shortcomings:
First, it is not possible to compress interword spaces
by the slightest amount
even if the breakpoint obtainable by widening is inacceptable.
Second, if a line that fits perfectly
is followed by a line with very loose spacing,
it might be better to move the last word
of the first line to the next one;
then both lines might have less than perfect spacing,
but it might nevertheless be more acceptable
than one line with very wide spaces.
.P
Both problems are addressed in \fIHeirloom \*[TR.]
As usual, the default behavior has not changed, though,
so identical output will be produced for existing documents
unless they are modified accordingly.
.S "Shrinking interword spaces"
.P
The ``.minss'' request allows to specify a minimum interword space.
It is only effective when adjusting both margins.
It accepts an argument with the same semantics as the ``.ss'' request,
i.e. a numeric value that is multiplied by 12/36
of the standard interword space.
The space size configured with ``.ss''
is taken as the optimum setting.
Thus with the default ``.ss\ 12'',
``.minss\ 9'' specifies that spaces
may be shrunk to 75 percent.
.P
The line breaking process is then changed
such that when the first word does not fit
on the current output line anymore,
\*(TR is allowed to shrink interword spaces
to make it fit
instead of deferring the word to the next line
and expanding the interword spaces on the current one.
\*(TR has a slight preference for shrinking built-in,
so if shrinking and expanding are equally far away
from the optimum,
shrinking is chosen.
If a line can be set with the optimum setting,
no shrinking is performed.

.sp 2
.xx 9 100 100 19 100 100 b 10.42P 12 "Shrink to 75\|% (.minss 9)"
.sp 2
While the second setting is certainly not perfect,
it is much better than the first one.
.S "Paragraph-at-once adjustment"
.P
Adjusting paragraph-at-once distributes the word spaces more evenly:
.sp 2
.xx 12 100 100 12 100 100 b 10.42P 12 "Line-by-line adjustment\p (.ad\ b)"
.sp 2
.xx 12 100 100 12 100 100 p 10.42P 12 "Paragraph-at-once adjustment\p (.ad\ p)"
.sp 2
.P
To address the problem of an unnecessarily loose line,
it is obviously necessary to look ahead
to following text.
Actually the best solution may involve multiple lines:
the line with sufficiently tight spacing
might occur several lines before the loose one,
and each line in between simply starts one word earlier
but contains the same number of words.
.P
For this reason, \*(TR collects the words of an entire paragraph
and computes optimal breakpoints when it is ended
with the next request causing a \fIbreak.\fR
Breakpoints are considered optimal
if all interword spaces in the paragraph
are as close to the optimum setting as possible.
.P
Once the optimal breakpoints have been computed,
the resulting lines are adjusted and
are then written to a temporary diversion.
Ultimately, this diversion is re-read in
\fInofill\fR mode.
At this time, \fIpage traps\fR become effective.
When the diversion has been emptied,
execution continues with the request
that initially caused the \fIbreak\fR
at the end of the paragraph.
.P
Paragraph-at-once adjustment is enabled per paragraph
with ``.ad\ p'';
the forms ``.ad\ pc'', ``.ad\ pl'', and ``.ad\ pr''
are also supported
and apply the method to centered, left-adjusted,
and right-adjusted text, respectively.
.P
The request ``.padj'' globally enables paragraph-at-once adjustment
across all environments;
it is especially useful to change existing documents
to use this mode.
.P
Since paragraph-at-once adjustment
uses the established diversion mechanism,
it is compatible with almost all existing \*(TR code.
Most importantly, it works with the standard
the ``\(enmm'', ``\(enms'', ``\(enme'',
and ``\(enman'' macro sets.
.P
Indenting and line length
can only be set for an entire paragraph
with the ``.in'', ``.ti'', and ``.ll'' requests,
and they cannot be changed from page traps
since the paragraph has already been adjusted
when they are invoked.
Documents that use such methods
e.g. for inline pictures
thus require changes in order
to be formatted with paragraph-at-once adjustment.

.P
Since positions on the output line
are not computed until the entire paragraph has been collected,
the ``.k'' and ``.x'' number registers
cannot contain meaningful values in paragraph-at-once adjustment mode.
Macros that test ``.k'' only to determine if there is text present
will work, though, since it is ensured that ``.k''
is never zero in this case.
.P
The number of the current page in the ``%'' register
can be lower than the number of the page
on which the current input word
will actually be printed
in paragraph-at-once adjustment mode.
Thus e.g. to prepare words for indexing,
it is not possible to associate them with page numbers
when the input is read.
\fIOutput-line traps\fR have been introduced to address this issue:
A ``\(rsP[xx]'' in input is passed through
all formatting and diversion processing
along with the word it has been attached to.
When the line containing it has been actually printed,
the macro ``xx'' is executed.
The behavior is then similar to a page trap.
Multiple output-line traps may occur on a single line.
.P
An index macro can use this mechanism
to defer the processing of an index term
until after the position of the word it refers to
has been determined:
.EX
&nr IXcount 0 1
&de IX
&de IX-\(rs\(rsn+[IXcount]
&write index \(rs\(rs\(rs\(rsn% \(rs\(rs$1
\(rs\(rs..
\(rs\(rsP[IX-\(rs\(rsn[IXcount]]\(rsc
&.
.sp
An
&IX \(dqindex term\(dq
index term is contained in this sample text.
.EE
This example macro takes the index term as a single argument.
It creates a separate macro on each invocation
and prepends an output-line trap calling it
to the following word.
The created macro then prints the current page number
(processed in this macro, thus preceded by four backslashes)
and the index term argument
(processed in the surrounding macro, thus preceded
by two backslashes).
.S Microtypography
To further enlarge the range available for adjustment
while reducing the amount by which interword spaces are affected,
\*(TR also allows to vary the size of interletter spaces
and the shape of glyphs with the ``.letadj'' request.
This process is called ``microtypography''.
.P
Microtypography must be applied with care.
While the eye is accustomed to varying interword spaces
which leave the individual words intact,
varying interletter spaces and letter shapes
distort the typeface as soon as they become noticable.
This is best demonstrated
by using them as an exclusive adjustment mechanism:
.sp 2
.xx 12 96 100 12 1000 100 p 10.42P 12 "Adjusting by word spacing only"
.sp 2
.xx 12 100 96.0 12 100 1000 p 10.42P 12 "Adjusting by glyph reshaping only"
.sp 2
In combination with adjustment of interword spaces,
and if applied with rather strict limits,
microtypography can have positive effects, though.
This is especially true when lines are short;
the sample text used so far can be formatted acceptably
only if shrinking of interword spaces,
paragraph-at-once adjustment,
and microtypography are all combined:
.sp 2
.xx 9 95 100 18 105 100 p 10.42P 12 "Paragraph-at-once adjustment, \
word spacing 75\|% to 150\|%, \
letter spacing 95\|% to 105\|%, no glyph reshaping \
(.letadj\ 95\ 100\ 18\ 105\ 100)"
.sp 2
.xx 9 95 98 18 105 102 p 10.42P 12 "Paragraph-at-once adjustment, \
word spacing 75\|% to 150\|%, \
letter spacing 95\|% to 105\|%, glyph reshaping 98\|% to 102\|% \
(.letadj\ 95\ 98\ 18\ 105\ 102)"
.sp 2
For layouts with longer lines than in this example,
best results are normally achieved
with even smaller ranges for letter spacing and glyph reshaping.
.S "Hyphenation penalties"
.P
By default,
\*(TR hyphenates words whenever necessary
in paragraph-at-once mode
to minimize the adjustment.
To reduce the number of hyphenations,
\fIhyphenation penalties\fR can be configured.
Then whenever a breakpoint involves a hyphenation,
it is treated as less optimal,
and another breakpoint that does not require
a hyphenated word may be preferred
even though more adjustment may become necessary.
.P
An additional penalty can be configured
for breakpoints that involve two successive hyphens.
.P
The ``.hypp'' request takes the single hyphen penalty
as its first argument
and the penalty for consecutive hyphens as second.
Effective penalties are between 10 and 200.
.P
The hyphenation penalties only make hyphens less likely
but do not limit them forcibly;
even with high penalties,
it is still possible that multiple consecutive hyphens are produced.
The ``.hlm'' request imposes a strict limit
on the number of consecutive hyphens.
It causes a certain breakpoint to be disabled completely
and can thus result in a non-optimal adjustment.
If e.g. more than four consecutive hyphens are to be avoided
by all means, ``.hlm'' is useful, though.
It is recommended to use it in combination with ``.spreadwarn''
to detect the problematic paragraphs.
.S "Paragraph shapes"
.P
The standard requests
for setting indent and line length
cannot be used inside a paragraph
in paragraph-at-once adjustment mode.
It is possible to define the shape of an entire paragraph
line-by-line with the ``.pshape'' request.
It takes a list of indent and line length pairs
as arguments;
the first pair applies to the first line of the paragraph,
the second pair to the second line, and so forth.
If the paragraph has more lines than pairs are given,
the last pair is used for them;
it it has less lines, the excess pairs are discarded.
A paragraph shape is applied to a single paragraph only;
it overrides the standard indent, temporary indent,
and line length settings,
of which indent and line length become effective
for the next paragraph again.

For example, it is possible to create
a paragraph whose shape forms a circle.
To create a holey shape like this,
define an indent and line pair
for each contiguous part
and use traps to move the resulting lines
in vertical direction to the desired position.
This is best done in a diversion
so that the whole structure is kept together;
diversion traps are the mechanism of choice then.
¶\ Admittedly, creating a circle with a hole
is hardly a serious application of the
``.pshape'' request.
Complicated shapes almost always require
a carefully wording of content,
so paragraph-at-once formatting
is only a limited aid when creating them.
But ``.pshape'' is also needed
to flow text around an image,
even if it has simply a rectangular shape.
¶\ If you know the ``\(rsparshape'' command from \*[TEX],
note that the indent
is included in the line length in \*[TR,]
so you have to add every first value to every second one
for reusing such shapes.\p

.S Notes
.P
For paragraph-at-once adjustment,
\*(TR uses a variation of the algorithm
originally developed by Donald Knuth
and Michael Plass for the \*[TEX] system².
.P
The \*(TR implemenation does not make multiple passes
with hyphenation disabled or enabled,
and does not restrict hyphenation to words located at feasible breakpoints.
This is because the hyphenation implementation used in \*(TR,
originally developed by Raph Levien as part of \fILibHnj\fR
and based on a \*[TEX] algorithm (by Franklin Liang³) as well,
has been found to hyphenate all words of a document
in just the same time as
consumed by a run of the line-breaking function
with average line lengths.
\*(TR does not penalize hyphenation by default.
.P
There is no total stretchability value for a line,
and the total shrinkability is used to determine
whether a breakpoing is feasible,
but not for computing its optimality.
\*(TR currently has a slight preference for tight lines.
It might make sense to have this configurable,
but it seems
that the fact that a line may be stretched or shrinked by a high amount
does not necessarily indicate the optimality of doing so.
.P
\*(TR makes no use of \fIfitness classes\fR
and does not prefer to group lines of similar non-optimal spacing.
This is because doing so may lead to a more even appearance
of the lines of a paragraph,
but at the expense of a less even appearance
if the entire document is considered.
For example, consider the case of
multiple consecutive lines with loose spacing:
If these lines are viewn in isolation,
their spacing looks harmonically.
If they are viewn as part of a document,
they look more bright than the rest.
It is not clear how to solve this
without optimizing the spacing globally for a document,
which is not a realistic option.
.P
Breakpoints that might occur at different lines
are currently not evaluated separately for each such line.
Future evaluation may indicate that doing so is necessary.
.P
\*(TR implements ``microtypography''
similarly as described
by Hàn Thế Thành for \*[TEX]\|\[foursuperior].
In particular, it performs a function like
``level 2 font expansion'' (p.\ 70),
i.e. it considers the possibility to shrink interletter spaces
and character shapes
when computing breakpoints.
Both stretchability and shrinkability
are considered for computing the optimality of a breakpoint,
but only as far as the width of the possible line is concerned;
the percentual adjustment limits do not influence optimality.
.P
The sample text is an excerpt of George Washington's
1796 Farewell address.
Its choice for this purpose is due to
examples in James Felici's
\fIComplete Manual of Typography\fR¹.
In comparison to the typesetting program
used by Felici,
\fIHeirloom troff\fR has a stricter preference for the
spacing settings configured as optimal.
Setting the minimum or maximum to more extreme values
will thus not result in much differences
in its output\(emunless
there is a line where the extremes
are actually the only option for automatic justification,
