Release ...
* troff: The ".trimat", ".bleedat, and ".cropat" " requests have been added
  to include advice about the "TrimBox", "BleedBox", and "CropBox" page
  parameters to a PDF distiller command, particularly for PDF/X generation.
* dpost: The "-M" option has been added. It can be used to print cut marks
  ("-M cut"), registration marks ("-M registration"), or both cut marks and
  registration marks ("-M cut:registration") in combination with the
  ".trimat" troff request.
* [nt]roff: The ".af" request now handles long register names correctly.
* troff: Kerning now works correctly in combination with leaders and
  fields.
* troff: The ".tm" and ".write" requests now correctly handle locale-
  dependent input characters as well as one-character escape sequences
  that are interpreted in copy mode such as "\&".
* [nt]roff: The "-msafe" macro now correctly removes the ".do pso",
  ".do open", and ".do opena" requests in -x1 (default) mode. They
  were previously removed in -x2 mode only.

Release 051212
* [nt]roff: The ".pso" request has been added; it reads the output of
  a command as input to troff.
* [nt]roff: The ".tmc" request has been added; it works like ".tm" but
  does not terminate the message with a newline.
* [nt]roff: The ".open", ".opena", ".write", ".writec", and ".close"
  requests have been added. They work like ".tm" but write to a named
  file.
* [nt]roff: The ".warn" request has been added; it enables additional
  warning messages. The "\n[.warn]" register prints bits representing
  the warning categories that are currently enabled.
* [nt]roff: The ".spreadlimit" request has been added; it can be used
  to print a warning when the adjustment computed for an output line
  exceeds a certain value.
* [nt]roff: The ".mediasize" request has been added; it causes dpost to
  specify the page size using the PostScript "setpagedevice" operator.
  This is mainly useful for creating PDF documents.
* [nt]roff: The "\n[hours]", "\n[minutes]", "\n[seconds]", and "\n[year]"
  registers have been added to print more parts of the current time.
* [nr]roff: Availability of extensions is now controlled using an "-xN"
  option, where "N" is the extension level. The previous "-x" and "-X"
  options are still accepted.
* [nt]roff: A "-msafe" macro package has been added; it disables those
  requests that allow to execute commands or to write to files. It is
  mainly useful for viewing manual pages.
* pic: An "-S" option has been added to disable the "sh" element.
* grap: An "-S" option has been added to disable the "sh" command.
* nroff: Recognize the "\s'n'" escape sequence and discard it for
  compatibility with troff.
* dpost: When writing Type 42 fonts, write the sfnts array in a different
  order to avoid an error with Acrobat Distiller.

Release 051202
* [nt]roff: When text is written to a diversion in nofill mode, spacing
  characters are preserved. This allows the text in the diversion to be
  adjusted later when it is actually printed. The "-X" option disables
  the new behavior.
* [nt]roff: The static limit on the number of if-else constructs has
  been removed.
* [nt]roff: The static limit on the number of nested diversions has been
  removed.
* [nt]roff: A maximum of 2000 characters (bytes) is now allowed as the
  total of all arguments to a macro.
* dpost: The inclusion of PostScript pictures has been fixed; it could
  generate invalid PostScript programs since release 051025 under certain
  circumstances.
* dpost: A "x X PSSetup" device request to support a "\X'PSSetup: ...'"
  escape sequence has been added. It can be used to include arbitrary
  PostScript code in the setup section of the output file.
* dpost/troff -mcolor: CMYK colors and arbitrary PostScript color spaces
  can now be used. The "setcolor" procedure in "color.ps" has been renamed
  to "_setcolor" in order to make this possible.
* [nt]roff: A ".psbb" command is now available to retrieve the bounding box
  of a PostScript document (particularly of an EPS image).
* dpost: DSC comments of included EPS images are now preserved.
* dpost: PostScript pictures that contain binary data can be included now.
* pic: Troff commands that begin with a "'" are now passed through.
* grap: Negative zeros in coordinate tick labels are now avoided.
* -man macros: Fixed the output of a very long line following ".TP".
* -mdoc macros: Changed the names of Courier fonts to \f(CW \f(CI to
  match those of troff.
* RPM package builds now require the new "Heirloom Development Tools"
  package from <http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/devtools.html> to be
  installed.

Release 051107
* The "checknr" utility has been added from OpenSolaris source code.
* The "ptx" utility has been added from Unix 7th Edition source code.
* When a locale-dependent or font-specific character was used directly
  after a macro that ended with a font switch, it was chosen from the
  old font. This has been fixed.
* The ".hidechar" request now works correctly if the selected font is
  not the current font.
* eqn: More narrow spaces are inserted at some roman/italic font changes
  now to better match the appearance of the current fonts.
* grap: The file "grap.defines" has been moved to $(LIBDIR).

Release 051031
* The "-mpm" macros and the "pm" program have been added from Plan 9 source
  code. They form a "-ms"-like package for vertical justification; the file
  "mpm/README" explains some details.
* eqn: The generated troff program is now resolution-independent; the "-r"
  option is no longer needed and is ignored.
* dpost: The elements of overbars, brackets, and braces align better now, in
  particular in respect to documents distilled by Ghostscript.
* In the "man" macro package, ".B" and similar font change macros now accept
  more than six arguments.
* tbl: The maximum length for "w(...)" width specifications has been raised
  from 10 to 100.
* The "make install" procedures of refer and vgrind have been fixed to work
  with RPM and similar package builds.

Release 051025
* The "pic" and "grap" utilities have been added from Plan 9 sources.
* The "vgrind" utility has been added from OpenSolaris sources.
* "refer" and related utilites have been added from OpenSolaris sources.
* [nt]roff: The new ".recursionlimit" request allows to change the maximum
  permitted recursion depth for macro invocations from the default 512.

Release 051015
* troff, dpost, otfdump: Handle TrueType files with version 3.0 "post" table
  and no Microsoft/Unicode "cmap" subtable.
* otfdump: Kerning information was omitted for all but the first font when
  multiple font file arguments were given. This has been fixed.
* troff: Fonts that contain possible ligatures (fi, fl, etc.) in their file
  names are now mounted correctly.
* dpost: Allow only the glyph at position 0 to be named ".notdef" when
  generating Type 42 font data.
* dpost: No longer leaves a stale temporary file in /var/tmp.
* tbl: Inspects the first 4000 rows of a table now (instead of the first 200)
  in order to determine column widths and "T{" blocks.
* tbl: Can handle more than 62 "T{" blocks per table now.

Release 051011
* troff/dpost: Support for OpenType fonts has been added. This includes
  support for CFF-based (PostScript) OpenType fonts as well as support for
  most TrueType fonts.
* otfdump: New utility that prints the contents of an OpenType font file in
  an ASCII format just as troff interprets it.
* troff: A ".ftr" request has been introduced as a font-specific variant of
  the ".tr" request.
* troff: A ".feature" request has been introduced to access special features
  of OpenType fonts.
* troff: Kerning is now applied to pairs of characters that originate from
  the same font mounted at two different positions.
* dpost: Can now access all characters in a large PostScript font, not only
  the first 255.
* dpost: If the data in a PFB file to be included does not end with a
  newline character, add one to the generated PostScript to achieve a
  consistent DSC structure (Bugreport by Sebastian Leusch).
* dpost: The limit of characters with "x X" commands has been raised from
  50 to 4096. This in particular allows to supply fonts with long path
  names.
* The "-mcolor" macros have been added from Plan 9 sources.

Release 050920
* troff: The handling of locale-dependent characters in copy mode has been
  fixed. Previously when such a character was given e.g. in an argument to
  a macro, it was chosen from the font in effect at the time when the macro
  call was read, instead of the one in effect at the time when the macro
  was executed.
* troff: The lookup of kerning pairs from the predefined tables has been
  fixed. It previously located inappropriate pairs in some cases.
* troff: Is now more resistent against invalid AFM files whose character
  count following the "StartCharMetrics" keyword is too large. Previously,
  no characters outside the default troff character set were accessible
  with such files.
* dpost: When an AFM-based font was mounted more than once in troff,
  localized input characters are now printed properly in all positions.
  Previously, localized characters were only printed properly on the
  position that was used first in the document.
* troff: Several requests for handling fonts did not recognize font names
  with more than two characters correctly with the "-x" option; they have
  been fixed.
* troff: The characters "\(aa", "\(ga", """, "\-", "<", ">", "@", "\", "^",
  and "~" are now always chosen from the Times Roman special font with
  AFM-based devices too, as it has been the case with other devices. To get
  the character from another PostScript font, use the PostScript character
  name, e.g. "\[less]". In contrast, "\(12", "\(14", and "\(34" are now
  chosen from the current font, as it has been the case with historic C/A/T
  output, but not with -Tpost.
* [nt]roff: The "-mm" macros no longer print "Sun Microsystems" in calls to
  ".AU" macros and the like.
* troff: The "\S" escape sequence has been fixed; its use could lead to core
  dumps with the previous release.
* troff: The procedure to determine whether to set the "2" value of the
  "\n(ct" register with AFM fonts should now work properly. This fixes the
  position of accents above lower-case characters with eqn.
* dpost: The maximum number of fonts that can appear in a single PostScript
  output file has been raised to 1536.
* eqn: All Greek upper-case letters, i.e. "ALPHA", "BETA", etc. are now
  recognized.
* [nt]roff: The escape sequence \U'n' sets the character at Unicode position
  "U+n", where "n" is a hexadecimal number.

Release 050915
* troff: Can now directly handle .afm/.pfb/.pfa files (i.e. PostScript
  Type 1 fonts) to select fonts. The ".fp" request has been extended
  for this, and the "TROFFONTS" environment variable specifies path
  names to search for font files. See the file "FONTS" for details.
* troff: Can now handle Type 42 fonts (i.e. TrueType fonts that have been
  converted for use by PostScript interpreters).
* troff: Handles input characters according to LC_CTYPE now in combination
  with the new font setup. In a UTF-8 locale, most characters that are
  present in standard, Expert, and Symbol PostScript fonts are supported;
  otherwise, a locale-specific subset of them is available.
* troff: A PostScript device with a resolution of 72000 dpi, named "ps",
  is available, and is used by default.
* troff: Support for pairwise kerning has been added. The default tables
  are read from the AFM files. In addition, a ".kernpair" request has been
  introduced to add or replace kerning pairs; it can construct kerning
  pairs for characters from different fonts. The ".kernafter" and
  ".kernbefore" requests add a constant amount of space to specific
  characters.
* dpost: The PostScript output is now expected to conform to Adobe's
  Document Structuring Conventions, version 3.0.
* dpost: PDF Bookmarks, titles and authorship information can be included
  into the generated PostScript for further processing by the distiller
  utility. See the file "PDFS" for details.
* [nt]roff: Hyphenation for languages other than English has been added
  using the "libhnj" variant from the OpenOffice project. The ".hylang"
  request has been introduced to select between languages. Hyphenation
  files have been derived from TeX sources.
* troff: The paper size can be selected with the ".papersize" request.
  This is important for correct placement of pages on PostScript printers.
* troff: Any point size can now be used with PostScript devices, including
  fractional sizes.
* troff: The ".fzoom" request allows to zoom the characters of a font.
* troff: Hanging characters are supported.
* [nt]roff: The ".lc_ctype" request can be used to set the LC_CTYPE
  localization setting from within a document.
* troff: It is now possible to use "\[name]", where name is a character
  defined in the .afm file for the current font.
* troff: The ".track" request for tracking letter space has been added.
* troff: The ".fallback" request for selecting the order in which fonts
  are searched for missing characters in the current font has been added.
* troff: The ".hidechar" request hides characters from a font which are
  then searched using the fallback sequence.
* troff: Ligatures from expert fonts can be used transparently with the
  ".flig" request.
* [nt]roff: Environments selected with the ".ev" command can be given
  names, and their number is no longer statically limited.
* [nt]roff: The ".evc" request copies another environment to the current
  one.
* [nt]roff: The ".chop" request deletes the last character from a macro,
  string, or diversion.
* [nt]roff: The ".return" request returns immediately from a macro.
* [nt]roff: The "\:" escape inserts an optional line break but generates
  no hyphen if the line is split.
* [nt]roff: The "\~" escape is similar to "\ " but inserts a space that
  stretches like a regular " " when the line is adjusted.
* [nt]roff: The "\E" escape is similar to "\e" but is not interpreted in
  copy mode.
* [nt]roff: The ".shift" request shifts the arguments to a macro.
* [nt]roff: The "\$(.." and "\$[...]" escapes can be used to refer to
  macro arguments.
* troff/dpost: The "\X'Sync'" escape forces dpost to write position and
  font information to the generated PostScript. This is sometimes useful
  to ensure that following "\X'PS: ...'" escapes work as expected.
* troff: The "-a" option now generates locale-dependent output, with best
  results in UTF-8 locales.
* The "-mpictures" macros have been added from Plan 9 sources.
* The "picpack" preprocessor has been added.
* eqn: The default resolution has been changed to 72000 dpi to match that
  of troff. The "-r" option was introduced to change it.
* eqn: Handles "\[]" and "\*[]" now.
* troff, dpost: Device and font descriptions are now read directly from
  text files; the "makedev" utility is no longer needed.
* [nt]roff: The ".xflag" request controls the availability of extensions
  like the "-x" and "-X" command line options.
* The file "NEWS" describes new troff language features.
* tbl: The specification "decimalpoint(x)" can now be used to make the
  character "x" the decimal point for numeric columns.
* tbl: There can now be up to 100 columns in a table.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of "-m" options anymore.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the ".hw" table anymore.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the pushback buffer anymore; this
  makes it possible to use longer arguments to macros.
* [nt]roff: The output of long names with ".pm" and stack dumps has been
  fixed.
* [nt]roff: Nested long-name string references \*[\*...] now work.
* [nt]roff: Tabulators as in ".XY\t" are now correctly handled with -x.
* The "-man" macro no longer produces cut marks when used with troff.
* tbl: Two bugs that had been introduced with support for lines of unlimited
  length have been fixed. They resulted in printing a stray character when
  more than one input file was used, and in improper handling of input lines
  continued with a backslash.
* A new malloc() replacement has been added for performance reasons.
* A bug in the previously supplied realloc() replacement could result in
  heap corruption.

Release 050816
* nroff: A special terminal name, -Tlocale, has been introduced. With this
  option, UTF-8 output is generated if permitted by the current LC_CTYPE
  locale, and regular -Tlp output otherwise.
* [nt]roff: A new option, "-x", enables the recognition of extended
  features that may affect compatibility with previous versions. The "-X"
  option disables these features; this is currently the default. Note
  that the features enabled with -x are under development and subject
  to change.
* [nt]roff: With the -x option, it is now possible to use ".de", ".ds",
  ".nr", and similar requests with more than two-character name arguments,
  as in ".de longname", and to access such macros later with ".longname",
  strings with "\*[longname]", and number registers with "\n[longname]".
* [nt]roff: The "\$@" and "\$*" escape sequences to print all arguments
  to a macro are now understood with the -x option.
* troff: The ".ss" command now accepts a second numeric argument with the
  -x option. If it is zero, no second space character is printed between
  sentences. Otherwise, a second space character with the same width as
  the first one is printed.
* [nt]roff: The static block list limit NBLIST has been removed, memory
  is now dynamically allocated as needed.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of macros/strings and
  the number of number registers anymore.
* -man: A defect in the supplied -man macro package caused headers and
  footers to be garbled when they were printed between parts of a tbl table
  that was split across pages.

Release 050813
* Initial release.
