* nroff: A special terminal name, -Tlocale, has been introduced. With this
  option, UTF-8 output is generated if permitted by the current LC_CTYPE
  locale, and regular -Tlp output otherwise.
* -man: A defect in the supplied -man macro package caused headers and
  footers to be garbled when they were printed between parts of a tbl table
  that was split across pages.
