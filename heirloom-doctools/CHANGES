Release ...
* dpost: If the data in a PFB file to be included does not end with a
  newline character, add one to the generated PostScript to achieve a
  consistent DSC structure (Bugreport by Sebastian Leusch).
* The "-mcolor" macros have been added from Plan 9 sources.

Release 050920
* troff: The handling of locale-dependent characters in copy mode has been
  fixed. Previously when such a character was given e.g. in an argument to
  a macro, it was chosen from the font in effect at the time when the macro
  call was read, instead of the one in effect at the time when the macro
  was executed.
* troff: The lookup of kerning pairs from the predefined tables has been
  fixed. It previously located inappropriate pairs in some cases.
* troff: Is now more resistent against invalid AFM files whose character
  count following the "StartCharMetrics" keyword is too large. Previously,
  no characters outside the default troff character set were accessible
  with such files.
* dpost: When an AFM-based font was mounted more than once in troff,
  localized input characters are now printed properly in all positions.
  Previously, localized characters were only printed properly on the
  position that was used first in the document.
* troff: Several requests for handling fonts did not recognize font names
  with more than two characters correctly with the "-x" option; they have
  been fixed.
* troff: The characters "\(aa", "\(ga", """, "\-", "<", ">", "@", "\", "^",
  and "~" are now always chosen from the Times Roman special font with
  AFM-based devices too, as it has been the case with other devices. To get
  the character from another PostScript font, use the PostScript character
  name, e.g. "\[less]". In contrast, "\(12", "\(14", and "\(34" are now
  chosen from the current font, as it has been the case with historic C/A/T
  output, but not with -Tpost.
* [nt]roff: The "-mm" macros no longer print "Sun Microsystems" in calls to
  ".AU" macros and the like.
* troff: The "\S" escape sequence has been fixed; its use could lead to core
  dumps with the previous release.
* troff: The procedure to determine whether to set the "2" value of the
  "\n(ct" register with AFM fonts should now work properly. This fixes the
  position of accents above lower-case characters with eqn.
* dpost: The maximum number of fonts that can appear in a single PostScript
  output file has been raised to 1536.
* eqn: All Greek upper-case letters, i.e. "ALPHA", "BETA", etc. are now
  recognized.
* [nt]roff: The escape sequence \U'n' sets the character at Unicode position
  "U+n", where "n" is a hexadecimal number.

Release 050915
* troff: Can now directly handle .afm/.pfb/.pfa files (i.e. PostScript
  Type 1 fonts) to select fonts. The ".fp" request has been extended
  for this, and the "TROFFONTS" environment variable specifies path
  names to search for font files. See the file "FONTS" for details.
* troff: Can now handle Type 42 fonts (i.e. TrueType fonts that have been
  converted for use by PostScript interpreters).
* troff: Handles input characters according to LC_CTYPE now in combination
  with the new font setup. In a UTF-8 locale, most characters that are
  present in standard, Expert, and Symbol PostScript fonts are supported;
  otherwise, a locale-specific subset of them is available.
* troff: A PostScript device with a resolution of 72000 dpi, named "ps",
  is available, and is used by default.
* troff: Support for pairwise kerning has been added. The default tables
  are read from the AFM files. In addition, a ".kernpair" request has been
  introduced to add or replace kerning pairs; it can construct kerning
  pairs for characters from different fonts. The ".kernafter" and
  ".kernbefore" requests add a constant amount of space to specific
  characters.
* dpost: The PostScript output is now expected to conform to Adobe's
  Document Structuring Conventions, version 3.0.
* dpost: PDF Bookmarks, titles and authorship information can be included
  into the generated PostScript for further processing by the distiller
  utility. See the file "PDFS" for details.
* [nt]roff: Hyphenation for languages other than English has been added
  using the "libhnj" variant from the OpenOffice project. The ".hylang"
  request has been introduced to select between languages. Hyphenation
  files have been derived from TeX sources.
* troff: The paper size can be selected with the ".papersize" request.
  This is important for correct placement of pages on PostScript printers.
* troff: Any point size can now be used with PostScript devices, including
  fractional sizes.
* troff: The ".fzoom" request allows to zoom the characters of a font.
* troff: Hanging characters are supported.
* [nt]roff: The ".lc_ctype" request can be used to set the LC_CTYPE
  localization setting from within a document.
* troff: It is now possible to use "\[name]", where name is a character
  defined in the .afm file for the current font.
* troff: The ".track" request for tracking letter space has been added.
* troff: The ".fallback" request for selecting the order in which fonts
  are searched for missing characters in the current font has been added.
* troff: The ".hidechar" request hides characters from a font which are
  then searched using the fallback sequence.
* troff: Ligatures from expert fonts can be used transparently with the
  ".flig" request.
* [nt]roff: Environments selected with the ".ev" command can be given
  names, and their number is no longer statically limited.
* [nt]roff: The ".evc" request copies another environment to the current
  one.
* [nt]roff: The ".chop" request deletes the last character from a macro,
  string, or diversion.
* [nt]roff: The ".return" request returns immediately from a macro.
* [nt]roff: The "\:" escape inserts an optional line break but generates
  no hyphen if the line is split.
* [nt]roff: The "\~" escape is similar to "\ " but inserts a space that
  stretches like a regular " " when the line is adjusted.
* [nt]roff: The "\E" escape is similar to "\e" but is not interpreted in
  copy mode.
* [nt]roff: The ".shift" request shifts the arguments to a macro.
* [nt]roff: The "\$(.." and "\$[...]" escapes can be used to refer to
  macro arguments.
* troff/dpost: The "\X'Sync'" escape forces dpost to write position and
  font information to the generated PostScript. This is sometimes useful
  to ensure that following "\X'PS: ...'" escapes work as expected.
* troff: The "-a" option now generates locale-dependent output, with best
  results in UTF-8 locales.
* The "-mpictures" macros have been added from Plan 9 sources.
* The "picpack" preprocessor has been added.
* eqn: The default resolution has been changed to 72000 dpi to match that
  of troff. The "-r" option was introduced to change it.
* eqn: Handles "\[]" and "\*[]" now.
* troff, dpost: Device and font descriptions are now read directly from
  text files; the "makedev" utility is no longer needed.
* [nt]roff: The ".xflag" request controls the availability of extensions
  like the "-x" and "-X" command line options.
* The file "NEWS" describes new troff language features.
* tbl: The specification "decimalpoint(x)" can now be used to make the
  character "x" the decimal point for numeric columns.
* tbl: There can now be up to 100 columns in a table.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of "-m" options anymore.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the ".hw" table anymore.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the pushback buffer anymore; this
  makes it possible to use longer arguments to macros.
* [nt]roff: The output of long names with ".pm" and stack dumps has been
  fixed.
* [nt]roff: Nested long-name string references \*[\*...] now work.
* [nt]roff: Tabulators as in ".XY\t" are now correctly handled with -x.
* The "-man" macro no longer produces cut marks when used with troff.
* tbl: Two bugs that had been introduced with support for lines of unlimited
  length have been fixed. They resulted in printing a stray character when
  more than one input file was used, and in improper handling of input lines
  continued with a backslash.
* A new malloc() replacement has been added for performance reasons.
* A bug in the previously supplied realloc() replacement could result in
  heap corruption.

Release 050816
* nroff: A special terminal name, -Tlocale, has been introduced. With this
  option, UTF-8 output is generated if permitted by the current LC_CTYPE
  locale, and regular -Tlp output otherwise.
* [nt]roff: A new option, "-x", enables the recognition of extended
  features that may affect compatibility with previous versions. The "-X"
  option disables these features; this is currently the default. Note
  that the features enabled with -x are under development and subject
  to change.
* [nt]roff: With the -x option, it is now possible to use ".de", ".ds",
  ".nr", and similar requests with more than two-character name arguments,
  as in ".de longname", and to access such macros later with ".longname",
  strings with "\*[longname]", and number registers with "\n[longname]".
* [nt]roff: The "\$@" and "\$*" escape sequences to print all arguments
  to a macro are now understood with the -x option.
* troff: The ".ss" command now accepts a second numeric argument with the
  -x option. If it is zero, no second space character is printed between
  sentences. Otherwise, a second space character with the same width as
  the first one is printed.
* [nt]roff: The static block list limit NBLIST has been removed, memory
  is now dynamically allocated as needed.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of macros/strings and
  the number of number registers anymore.
* -man: A defect in the supplied -man macro package caused headers and
  footers to be garbled when they were printed between parts of a tbl table
  that was split across pages.

Release 050813
* Initial release.
