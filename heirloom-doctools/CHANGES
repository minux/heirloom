Release ...
* troff: Can now directly handle .afm/.pfb/.pfa files (i.e. PostScript
  Type 1 fonts) to select fonts with the -x option. The new request
  ".fpost" has been introduced for this. See the file "FONTS" for
  details.
* troff: Can now handle Type 42 fonts (i.e. TrueType fonts that have been
  converted for use by PostScript interpreters).
* troff: Handles input characters according to LC_CTYPE now in combination
  with the new font setup. In a UTF-8 locale, most characters that are
  present in standard, Expert, and Symbol PostScript fonts are supported;
  otherwise, a locale-specific subset of them is available.
* troff: A PostScript device with a resolution of 7200 dpi, named "7200",
  is available, and is used by default.
* troff: Support for pairwise kerning has been added.
* dpost: The PostScript output is now expected to conform to Adobe's
  Document Structuring Conventions, version 3.0.
* [nt]roff: Hyphenation for languages other than English has been added
  using the "libhnj" variant from the OpenOffice project. The ".hylang"
  request has been introduced to select between languages.
* troff: The ".fzoom" request allows to zoom the characters of a font.
* [nt]roff: The ".lc_ctype" request can be used to set the LC_CTYPE
  localization setting from within a document.
* troff: It is now possible to use "\[name]", where name is a character
  defined in the .afm file for the current font.
* troff: The ".tkf" request for tracking letter space has been added.
* troff: The ".fallback" request for selecting the order in which fonts
  are searched for missing characters in the current font has been added.
* troff: The ".hidechar" request hides characters from a font which are
  then searched using the fallback sequence.
* [nt]roff: Environments selected with the ".ev" command can be given
  names, and their number is no longer statically limited.
* [nt]roff: The ".evc" request copies another environment to the current
  one.
* [nt]roff: The ".chop" request deletes the last character from a macro,
  string, or diversion.
* [nt]roff: The ".return" request returns immediately from a macro.
* [nt]roff: The "\:" escape inserts an optional line break but generates
  no hyphen if the line is split.
* [nt]roff: The "\~" escape is similar to "\ " but inserts a space that
  stretches like a regular " " when the line is adjusted.
* [nt]roff: The "\E" escape is similar to "\e" but is not interpreted in
  copy mode.
* troff/dpost: The "\X'Sync'" escape forces dpost to write position and
  font information to the generated PostScript. This is sometimes useful
  to ensure that following "\X'PS: ...'" escapes work as expected.
* The "-mpictures" macros have been added from Plan 9 sources.
* The "picpack" preprocessor has been added.
* The file "NEWS" describes new troff language features.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of "-m" options anymore.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the ".hw" table anymore.
* [nt]roff: The output of long names with ".pm" and stack dumps has been
  fixed.
* [nt]roff: Nested long-name string references \*[\*...] now work.
* [nt]roff: Tabulators as in ".XY\t" are now correctly handled with -x.
* A new malloc() replacement has been added for performance reasons.
* A bug in the previously supplied realloc() replacement could result in
  heap corruption.

Release 050816
* nroff: A special terminal name, -Tlocale, has been introduced. With this
  option, UTF-8 output is generated if permitted by the current LC_CTYPE
  locale, and regular -Tlp output otherwise.
* [nt]roff: A new option, "-x", enables the recognition of extended
  features that may affect compatibility with previous versions. The "-X"
  option disables these features; this is currently the default. Note
  that the features enabled with -x are under development and subject
  to change.
* [nt]roff: With the -x option, it is now possible to use ".de", ".ds",
  ".nr", and similar requests with more than two-character name arguments,
  as in ".de longname", and to access such macros later with ".longname",
  strings with "\*[longname]", and number registers with "\n[longname]".
* [nt]roff: The "\$@" and "\$*" escape sequences to print all arguments
  to a macro are now understood with the -x option.
* troff: The ".ss" command now accepts a second numeric argument with the
  -x option. If it is zero, no second space character is printed between
  sentences. Otherwise, a second space character with the same width as
  the first one is printed.
* [nt]roff: The static block list limit NBLIST has been removed, memory
  is now dynamically allocated as needed.
* [nt]roff: There is no static limit on the number of macros/strings and
  the number of number registers anymore.
* -man: A defect in the supplied -man macro package caused headers and
  footers to be garbled when they were printed between parts of a tbl table
  that was split across pages.
