README file for the Heirloom Documentation Tools
================================================

The Heirloom Documentation Tools provide troff, nroff, and related
utilities to format manual pages and other documents for output on
terminals and printers. They are portable and partially enhanced
versions of the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris.

The source code is known to compile on:

Linux		glibc, diet libc
Solaris		9 and above
HP-UX		B.11.11 and above
FreeBSD		5.4
NetBSD		2.0

To build and install, see the settings in the "mk.config" and adjust
them if necessary. You can also build a RPM package with the command
"rpmbuild -tb heirloom-doctools-<version>.tar.bz2".

troff currently reads several binary files which are built during
the compilation process. It is thus not possible to cross-compile.

In order to use the utilities for formatting manual pages, note the
following:

- You will almost exclusively want to use "nroff -Tlp". By default,
  nroff generates output for a Teletype Model 37 with half-line
  capabilities which will lead to weird results with any xterm or
  CRT terminal.

- You need to filter the output of nroff through "col -x". 

- The terminal description for "-Tlp" is now built-in with nroff.
  For a small system distribution, it is thus not necessary to
  install the "nterm" directory.

- You need at least the "an" macro file to format manual pages. If
  you also want to use the Berkeley "doc" macros, you also need
  "doc*" and "andoc". "nroff -mandoc" will then switch automatically
  between the two macro packages.

- Thus a complete pipeline to format manual pages for viewing is:
  tbl input.1 | neqn | nroff -Tlp -mandoc | col -x

- To print manual pages with troff, use
  tbl input.1 | eqn | troff -mandoc | dpost | lp

- You should of course configure your "man" command such that it
  executes these pipelines automatically for you.

The troff driver for the Autologic APS-5 is currently still included.
It is untested and will likely vanish from this package unless somebody
complains and is willing and able to support it.
