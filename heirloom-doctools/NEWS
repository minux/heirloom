New features in the Heirloom Documentation Tools troff language
===============================================================

Unless otherwise noted, new features become effective with the -x option
only. In the future, the -x option may become the default; the -X option
can be used to deactivate new features for compatibility reasons.

.afm yy basename [register]				troff only
	reads metrics from the file "fontdir/afm/basename.afm". The font
	is then available with ".ft yy", "\f(yy", etc. The optional
	"register" argument can be used to specify a font position to
	which this font is to be mounted, as with the ".fp" command.

.de longname
.ds longname
.nr longname
	The names of macros, strings, and number registers can be longer
	than two characters now.

.fallback ff aa bb ...					troff only
	Selects the fallback sequence for font ff. If the current font
	is ff and a character is not found, font aa is searched first,
	then font bb, etc. If the character still has not been found,
	it is searched for in font S, then in font 0, 1, and so forth.

.lc_ctype localename
	sets the LC_CTYPE locale setting to localename. The default is
	the value of the LC_CTYPE environment variable. This request is
	useful to specify an input character set regardless of environment
	influences.

.ss n m							troff only
	with the second argument "m" determines whether additional white
	space is added between sentences. If m is zero, no additional
	white space is added. Otherwise, a space of size n is added as
	usual.

.supply basename					troff only
	causes dpost to include data from "fontdir/pfb/basename.pfb" into
	the generated PostScript. This is useful to include fonts that have
	not yet been downloaded into the printer, or for generating PDFs
	with additional fonts.

.tkf ff s1 n1 s2 n2					troff only
	specifies tracking of letter space for font ff. If the current font
	is ff and the point size is below or equal to s1, white space of
	width n1 is added to each character. If the point size is above or
	equal to s2, white space of width n2 is added. If the point size
	is between s1 and s2, the amount of white space added is computed
	as a value between n1 and n2 using the current point size s:
	(s * n2 - s * n1 + s2 * n1 - s1 * n2) / (s2 - s1). The default unit
	for all numeric arguments is "p". Negative numbers are accepted and
	cause a decrease of letter space.

\[name]							troff only
	selects the character "name" as defined in the .afm file for the
	current font.

\*[name]
	refers to the string "name".

\n[name]
	refers to the number register "name".

\$*
	prints all arguments to a macro, separated by spaces.

\$@
	prints all arguments to a macro, each one surrounded by double
	quotes, separated by spaces.

any character in the current LC_CTYPE locale
	In nroff, any printable character is just passed through.
	In troff, the character is converted to a PostScript character
	name. If it is found in the current font, it is printed.
	Otherwise, the .fallback sequence is searched for it. This
	mechanism only works with fonts mounted by the .afm request.

                                                                8/19/05
