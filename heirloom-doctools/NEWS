New features in the Heirloom Documentation Tools troff language
===============================================================

Unless otherwise noted, new features become effective with the -x option
only. In the future, the -x option may become the default; the -X option
can be used to deactivate new features for compatibility reasons.

.chop name
	removes the last character of the macro, string, or diversion
	"name".

.de longname
.ds longname
.nr longname
	The names of macros, strings, and number registers can be longer
	than two characters now.

.ev name
	Environments can be named, or be given an arbitrary number.

.evc name
	copies the environment "name" into the current environment.
	The temporary state of the current environment is reset, and
	incompletely filled lines are discarded.

.fallback ff aa bb ...					troff only
	selects the fallback sequence for font ff. If the current font
	is ff and a character is not found, font aa is searched first,
	then font bb, etc. If the character still has not been found,
	it is searched for in font S, then in font 0, 1, and so forth.

.fpost r yy basename [pfb|pfa|t42]
	reads metrics from the file "fontdir/afm/basename.afm". The font
	is then available with ".ft yy", "\f(yy", etc.; "yy" may be the
	name of an existing ditroff-style font, such as "R", or may be
	freely chosen. The "r" argument specifies a register on which
	the font is to be mounted; if it is zero or too large, the font
	is mounted on a free position. Contrasting to the ".fp" request,
	the "r" argument may consist of more than a single digit. If
	the optional "pfb|pfa|t42" argument is present, data from the
	file "fontdir/pfb/basename.pfb" (or pfa/t42, respectively) is
	included into the generated PostScript. This is useful to
	include fonts that have not yet been downloaded into the
	printer, or for generating PDFs with additional fonts.

.hidechar ff c d ...					troff only
	hides the characters c, d, etc. from font ff. If the characters
	appear in input afterwards, they are searched in other fonts
	using the fallback sequence. This is useful e.g. for combining
	characters from a regular and an expert font.

.lc_ctype localename
	sets the LC_CTYPE locale setting to localename. The default is
	the value of the LC_CTYPE environment variable. This request is
	useful to specify an input character set regardless of environment
	influences.

.return
	immediately returns from the current macro to the level above.

.ss n m							troff only
	with the second argument "m" determines whether additional white
	space is added between sentences. If m is zero, no additional
	white space is added. Otherwise, a space of size n is added as
	usual.

.tkf ff s1 n1 s2 n2					troff only
	specifies tracking of letter space for font ff. If the current font
	is ff and the point size is below or equal to s1, white space of
	width n1 is added to each character. If the point size is above or
	equal to s2, white space of width n2 is added. If the point size
	is between s1 and s2, the amount of white space added is computed
	as a value between n1 and n2 using the current point size s:
	(s * n2 - s * n1 + s2 * n1 - s1 * n2) / (s2 - s1). The default unit
	for all numeric arguments is "p". Negative numbers are accepted and
	cause a decrease of letter space.

\[name]							troff only
	selects the character "name" as defined in the .afm file for the
	current font.

\*[name]
	refers to the string "name".

\n[name]
	refers to the number register "name".

\$*
	prints all arguments to a macro, separated by spaces.

\$@
	prints all arguments to a macro, each one surrounded by double
	quotes, separated by spaces.

any character in the current LC_CTYPE locale
	In nroff, any printable character is just passed through.
	In troff, the character is converted to a PostScript character
	name. If it is found in the current font, it is printed.
	Otherwise, the .fallback sequence is searched for it. This
	mechanism only works with fonts mounted by the .fpost request.

\X'Sync'
	forces dpost to write position and font information to the
	generated PostScript exactly at the place where this escape
	sequence occurs. This is sometimes useful to ensure that
	following "\X'PS: ...'" commands work as expected.
