Release ...
* lex: The functions "allprint_w", "reject_w", "yyless_w", "reject_e",
  and "yyless_e" are now included in libl.a for use with the "-w" and
  "-e" options, respectively.
* lex: The "yyin" and "yyout" file descriptors now point to "stdin" and
  "stdout" when calling main() as it has been historically the case on
  Unix systems. This requires the use of non-standard compiler features
  and currently only works with gcc, Sun C, and HP ANSI C. Otherwise,
  these descriptors are initialized at the first call to yylex(), as it
  had been the case with the previous release.
* lex: The driver files have been moved to /usr/ccs/lib/lex to match the
  location on historic Unix systems.
* yacc, lex: The generated files no longer include <inttypes.h>.
