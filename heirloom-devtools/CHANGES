Release ...
* The "yyin" and "yyout" file descriptors now point to "stdin" and "stdout"
  when calling main() as it has been historically the case on Unix systems.
  This requires the use of non-standard compiler features and currently
  only works with gcc, Sun C, and HP ANSI C. Otherwise, these descriptors
  are initialized at the first call to yylex(), as it had been the case with
  the previous release.
