Release ...
* m4: Handle multibyte quote characters with defn() correctly (patch by
  Joe Krahn).
* make: Mac OS X compilation fix (Stefan Tramm).
* make: Compilation fix for 64-bit environments.
* make: Do not crash if a backslash appears at the end of the value of
  the MAKEFLAGS environment variable, and preserve trailing spaces in macro
  names (bug reported by Stefano Lattarini).

Release 070527
* admin: A manual page is available, based on source code released by Sun.
* make: Macro definitions following "else" in an effective branch are
  now handled correctly.
* make: Removed a "extern char **environ;" declaration to make it
  compile on CentOS 5.
* vc: Recognizes the control character according to the LC_CTYPE locale
  now, and has no static size limits anymore.
* lex: Avoid a symbol conflict with the index() function that caused the
  build to fail on some platforms.

Release 070311
* make: The SVR4.2 syntax for parallel builds has been added. This adds
  the "-B" and "-P" options as well as the ".MUTEX:" special target.
* make: The SVR4.2 "-w" option has been added to suppress warnings.
* make: The "-u" option (unconditionally make the targets, even those
  that are not outdated) is now a documented feature.
* make: Comments following "ifeq" and other conditionals are now handled
  correctly.
* make: Error messages now include message numbers for use with the
  "help" command.
* sccs: The commands "-R info", "-R tell", and "-R clean" now operate
  correctly. They previously terminated operation prematurely when an
  "SCCS" directory was found but other sub-directories at the current
  recursion level had not yet been processed.

Release 070218
* sccs: A "-R" option has been added to enable recursive operation on
  subdirectories.
* sccs: A manual page has been added (based on the 4.3BSD-Tahoe page).
* make: The default variant now has the ".GET:" special target enabled
  to retrieve data from an s.file in the current directory, similar to
  the ".GET_POSIX:" target in the POSIX variant and the behavior of the
  SVR4 variant.
* make: The GNU syntax for conditional macros, "target: variable=value",
  is now accepted.
* make: The GNU syntax for parse-time conditionals, "ifeq (arg1, arg2)",
  "ifdef name", etc., is now supported.
* make: Partial support for GNU style functions, "$(function arguments)",
  has been added. Currently, the supported functions are "dir", "notdir",
  "suffix", "basename", "addsuffix", "addprefix", "join", "wildcard",
  "subst", "patsubst", "strip", "findstring", "filter", "filter-out",
  "sort", "word", "wordlist", "words", "firstword", "shell", "error", and
  "warning".
* make: Fixed the "-jn" option for recursive operation if given without
  space between option and option argument; it was previously ignored.

Release 070211
* SCCS: Most of the manual pages are now available, based on source code
  released by Sun.
* make: Use a POSIX shell or a Bourne shell as default value for $(SHELL)
  depending on whether POSIX mode is enabled or not. The path names of
  these shells are set in "mk.config". Both default to "/bin/sh" to ensure
  that the package can be built portably, thus to actually use this feature,
  install the Heirloom Bourne shell in advance and then edit "mk.config".
* make: A new manual page is available, based on source code released by
  Sun.
* get: The %G% and %H% keywords omit leading zero digits in month or day
  numbers now, as previous (non-Solaris) versions of SCCS did.
* The tools have been ported to HP-UX.
* The tools have been ported to AIX.

Release 070119
* The "make" command has been added from OpenSolaris sources. Important
  changes to the OpenSolaris version are:

  * The "-j jobs" option is available, based on code distributed by Sun
    that was previously disabled.
  * SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE is "GNU" by default. This has the effect that
    macro definitions on the command line become part of the MAKEFLAGS
    variable, and thus override definitions within makefiles in recursive
    operation. Also "$<" resolves to the first prerequisite in a target
    rule. Setting "SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE=SUN" in the environment restores
    the previous behavior.

* sccs: Accept the "-a", "-p", and "-B" options to "diff" with the "diffs"
  and "sccsdiff" sub-commands.
* sccsdiff: Accept the "-a" and "-B" options to "diff"; also accept the
  "-P" option but pass it as "-p" to "diff".
* get: Do not dump core on a corrupted s-file.
* Mac OS X portability fixes (Stefan Tramm).
* SCCS: Handle the timezone offset on FreeBSD (bugreport by Joerg Schilling).
* SCCS: Use O_EXCL when opening files with unique names (thanks to Joerg
  Schilling for notification).

Release 070102
* delta: If the "bdiff" utility cannot be found, execute regular "diff"
  instead. This removes a circular dependency on the Heirloom Toolchest
  on systems lacking "bdiff" in their default installation, such as
  Linux or FreeBSD.
* SCCS: Do not use the SYS_NMLN constant since it is not portable (bug
  reported by John Cowan).
* help: Fixed for arguments consisting of letters only (command usage),
  default messages file, and error message if no appropriate key could
  be found. These problems had been introduced with the removal of the
  internationalization code during the port.

Release 061220
* The SCCS version control system has been added as a port of the source
  code released by Sun yesterday.
* lex: An appropriate prototype for yyreject() is now supplied when the
  -e or -w options are used.

Release 051216
* m4: The traditional variant now accepts the shift operators "<<" and
  ">>" for the "eval" macro.
* m4: The "eval" macro now uses 32-bit signed integer arithmetic
  regardless of the host architecture, as specified by both SVID3 and
  SUSv3.
* lex: The functions "allprint_w", "reject_w", "yyless_w", "reject_e",
  and "yyless_e" are now included in libl.a for use with the "-w" and
  "-e" options, respectively.
* lex: The "yyin" and "yyout" file descriptors now point to "stdin" and
  "stdout" when calling main() as it has been historically the case on
  Unix systems. This requires the use of non-standard compiler features
  and currently only works with gcc, Sun C, and HP ANSI C. Otherwise,
  these descriptors are initialized at the first call to yylex(), as it
  had been the case with the previous release.
* lex: The driver files have been moved to /usr/ccs/lib/lex to match the
  location on historic Unix systems.
* yacc, lex: The generated files no longer include <inttypes.h>.

Release 051113
* Initial release.
