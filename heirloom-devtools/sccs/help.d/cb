*	Message for comb SCCS command
*
-1
"p-file exists"
Someone is in the process of making a delta on the named SCCS
file. Comb may only be used when no one else is modifying
the named SCCS file.
-2
"can't have both -p and -c"
The '-p' and '-c' key letter arguments specify mutually
exclusive conditions.  Therefore, they may not be specified
on the same command line.
-3
"SID doesn't exist"
The SID you specified in one of the arguments to comb does
not exist in the named SCCS-file.
-4
"nothing to do"
The argument specified to comb would result in no changes made
to the named SCCS-file.  Therefore, it can't do anything to
the named SCCS-file.
