followed the flag with a value. This is not allowed.
-13
"value after ... flag"
You supplied an 'f' keyletter to add the flag named, and
you also supplied a value for the flag. However, the named flag
cannot be assigned a value.
-14

You are trying to add the 'd' flag (default SID) to the
SCCS file, but you did not supply an SID for it.
This flag must have an SID.
-15
"more than one file"
You are trying to create more than one SCCS file, and you supplied

the 'i' keyletter.
-16
"r only allowed with i"
You specified the 'r' keyletter for an SCCS file without
also specifying the 'i' keyletter. The 'r' keyletter may not be
specified except with the 'i' keyletter.
-17

You were creating a new SCCS file, and you specified the
't' keyletter, but you did not supply the name of the text file
from which to take commentary.
-18
"d not allowed with n"
You are trying to delete flags from a non-existent but being-created
SCCS file. You can only do this to old files.
-19

exists.
-20

"bad list format"
The format for the list of locked releases is syntactically incorrect.
The correct format for a list is:

		<list>  ::= <range> | <list>,<range>
		<range> ::= REL_NO | ``a''

where REL_NO is considered to be the first component in a
_SCCS __IDentification string (SID).
-28
"element in list out of range"
An element contained in the list for ``locking'' or ``unlocking''
releases is out of range.
That means its value is probably greater than 9999,
the maximum release number.
-29
directory `...' specified as `...' keyletter value
The value specified with the named keyletter argument is
a directory.  This is not allowed since the SCCS file created
would not be accessible by other SCCS commands.

The `y' and `m' keyletters for "admin" may only be used in
conjunction with the `i' or `n' keyletters, i.e. when creating a
new SCCS file.  Use "cdc" to change comments or MR numbers of an
existing file.
-31
"No newline at end of file ..."
The last line in the file you supplied for the 't' keyletter does 
not  end with a newline.  It is illegal to input such data to the 
description file.
-32
"Not a text file"
The file begins with the SCCS control character (ASCII 001) or 
contains ASCII NUL, or does not end with a NEWLINE. This file is
recognized as a binary data file. The contents of such files are
stored in the history file in encoded form.
