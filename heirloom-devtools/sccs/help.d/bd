*	Messages for bdiff.
*
-1
"arg count"
You invoked bdiff with either too few or too many arguments.
-2
"both files standard input"
You supplied a name of '-' for both file-name arguments to bdiff.
Since '-' means to read the standard input, you are
requesting that bdiff read it for both its inputs.
That would lead to highly grungeular randomness.
-3
"cannot fork, try again"
Bdiff could not fork to invoke 'diff'.
This is a system problem which may go away, so try again.
If it doesn't, report it to the system support group.
-4
"non-numeric limit"
The argument supplied to bdiff to specify the segmentation limit
bdiff is to use is not numeric.
Only numeric characters may appear in this argument.
-5
"cannot execute ..."
The named program could not be executed by bdiff.
It may be unexecutable, or it may have been removed.
Contact SCCS support personnel for further assistance.
-6
"... failed"
The named program terminated with an error.
It may have discovered an error condition or may have been interrupted.
Contact SCCS support personnel for further assistance.
-7
"can not write ..."
An attempt to write to a temporary file in /tmp has been unsuccessful.
The file system is probably out of space.
See your System Administrator.
