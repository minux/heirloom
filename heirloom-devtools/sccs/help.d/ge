*	Messages for get command of SCCS.
*
-3
"e not allowed with m"
You can't use both the -e and -m arguments on the same get command.
-4
"writable `...' exists"
For safety's sake, SCCS won't overwrite an existing g-file if it's writable.
If you don't need the g-file, remove it and rerun the get command.
-5
"nonexistent sid"
The specified sid does not exist in the
given file.
Check for typos.
-9
"... already included"
You mentioned the same delta twice with an -i and/or an -x argument.
-10
"... already excluded"
You mentioned the same delta twice with an -x and/or an -i argument.
-11
"internal error in get/enter()"
``Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate''
This shouldn't have happened!!
Do a "help stuck".
-17
"being edited: `...'"
You can't do a get with an -e argument because someone else already
did and hasn't made a delta yet.  If that someone else is really you,
you can regenerate a new file to be edited, if necessary, by using the -k
argument.  If you want to cancel the reservation entirely, see your
SCCS administrator, and tell him/her you want the p-file edited.

The data in quotes is from the p-file.
-18
"being edited: `...'"
Someone else has done a get with an -e argument.
This can't hurt what you're doing,
but isn't it nice to know that someone else
is making deltas to this file too?
-19
"release locked against editing"
The release retrieved by `get' for editing purposes (get -e )
is locked against further editing.
"prs -d:LK:" on the SCCS file tells you which releases are locked.
The `admin' command is used to lock and unlock releases.
-20
"curdir failed"
Re-check what you did.  Re-try the command.  If the problem persists,
contact your local UNIX administrator.
-21
"cannot change directory"
If you know the directory name, then check to see if it exists.
Re-try the command.  If the problem persists, contact your
local UNIX administrator.
-22
"r out of range"
The release number specified with the -r keyletter is out of range.
This means the number was greater than 9999 or less than 1.
-23
"No sid prior to cutoff date-time"
The cutoff date-time given by the user using -cdatetime is prior to 
the creation date of the s.file.
