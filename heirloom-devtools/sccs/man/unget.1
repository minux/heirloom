.SH NAME
unget \- undo a previous get of an SCCS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunget\fR [\fB\-ns\fR] [\fB\-r\fR\fIsid\fR] \fIs.filename\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBunget\fR utility undoes the effect of a \fBget\fR\fB\-e\fR command executed before the creation of the pending delta.
.PP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBunget\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per
line.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Retains the retrieved version, which is otherwise removed.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Suppress display of the \fBSCCS\fR delta \fBID\fR (SID).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR\fIsid\fR
When multiple versions are checked out, this option specifies which pending delta to abort.
A diagnostic results if the specified \fBSID\fR is ambiguous, or if it is necessary but omitted from the command line.

\fBhelp\fR(1)).
