.SH NAME
what \- extract SCCS version information from a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwhat\fR [\fB\-s\fR] \fIfilename\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwhat\fR utility searches each \fIfilename\fR for occurrences of the pattern \fB@(#)\fR that the \s-1SCCS\s+1 \fIget\fR command (see 
\fIget\fR(1)) substitutes for the \fB@(#)\fR ID keyword, and prints what follows up to a \fB"\fR, \fB>\fR, \fBNEWLINE\fR, \fB\e\fR, or \fBNULL\fR character.
For example, if a C program in file \fBprogram.c\fR contains
.sp
.RS
.nf
char sccsid[\|] = "\|@(#)identification information\|";
.fi
.RE
.sp
and \fBprogram.c\fR is compiled to yield \fBprogram.o\fR and \fBa.out\fR, the command:
.sp
.RS
.nf
$ \fBwhat program.c program.o a.out\fR
.fi
.RE
.sp
produces:
.RS
.TP 10
\fBprogram.c\fR:\fR
identification information
.TP
\fBprogram.o\fR:\fR
identification information
.TP
\fBa.out\fR:\fR
identification information
.RE
.PP
The following option is accepted:
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Stops after the first occurrence of the pattern.
.PP
The following exit values are returned:
.TP
\fB0\fR \fR
Any matches were found.
.TP
\fB1\fR \fR
No matches found.
.SH SEE ALSO
get(1), 
help(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Use the \s-1SCCS\s+1 \fIhelp\fR command for explanations (see 
\fIhelp\fR(1)).
.SH NOTES
There is a remote possibility that a spurious occurrence of the `\fB@(#)\fR' pattern could be found by \fIwhat\fR.
