README file for the Heirloom Development Tools
==============================================

The Heirloom Development Tools provide yacc, lex, m4, make, and
SCCS, as portable derivatives of the utilities released by Sun
as part of OpenSolaris. The OpenSolaris utilities were in turn
derived from the original Unix versions, and are assumed be
conforming implementations of the POSIX standard.

Note that the manual page for m4 is not yet available under
an Open Source license. In the meantime, please refer to the
online Solaris documentation at <http://docs.sun.com>. There
have been very few semantical changes with it, so the
description is still generally applicable.

The source code has been compiled successfully on:

Linux		glibc
Solaris		10 and above
HP-UX		B.11.11
AIX		5.1
FreeBSD		5.4, 6.1
Open UNIX	8.0.0
Mac OS X	10.4.3

It is likely to compile on other systems that provide the necessary
wide-character functionality.

To build and install the RPM package:

- Execute "rpmbuild -tb heirloom-devtools-<version>.tar.bz2". The
  result can be found in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 (or likewise)
  and can be installed using "rpm -U".

To build and install manually:

- Adjust the installation paths and compiler settings in the file
  "mk.config", which is in makefile syntax.

- Execute "make", followed by "make install". "make mrproper" will
  destroy all generated files.
