README file for the Heirloom Development Tools
==============================================

The Heirloom Development Tools provide yacc, lex, and m4, as portable
derivatives of the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris.
The OpenSolaris utilities were in turn derived from the original Unix
versions, and are assumed be conforming implementations of the POSIX
standard.

The source code is known to compile on:

Linux		glibc
Solaris		10 and above
HP-UX		B.11.11
FreeBSD		5.4

It is likely to compile on other systems that provide the necessary
wide-character functionality.

To build and install, see the settings in the "mk.config" and adjust
them if necessary. You can also build a RPM package with the command
"rpmbuild -tb heirloom-devtools-<version>.tar.bz2".

New releases of this project are announced on Freshmeat. If you want to
